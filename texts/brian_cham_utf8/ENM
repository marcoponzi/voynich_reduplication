the canterbury tales  
 
the prologue  
 
when that aprilis  with his showers swoot  
the drought of march hath pierced to the root  
and bathed every vein in such licour  
of which virtue engender d is the flower  
when zephyrus eke with his swoote breath 
inspired hath in every holt and heath 
the tender croppes and the younge sun 
hath in the ramhis halfe course y run  
and smalle fowles make melody  
that sleepen all the night with open eye  
so pricketh them nature in their corages  
then longe folk to go on pilgrimages  
and palmers for to seeke strange strands  
to ferne hallows couth in sundry lands  
and specially  from every shire s end 
of engleland  to canterbury they wend  
the holy blissful martyr for to seek  
that them hath holpen  when that they were sick  
befell that  in that season on a day  
in southwark at the tabard as i lay  
ready to wenden on my pilgrimage 
to canterbury with devout corage  
at night was come into that hostelry 
well nine and twenty in a company 
of sundry folk  by aventure y fall 
in fellowship  and pilgrims were they all  into company  
that toward canterbury woulde ride  
the chamber  and the stables were wide  
and well we weren eased at the best  
and shortly  when the sunne was to rest  with the best 
so had i spoken with them every one  
that i was of their fellowship anon  
and made forword early for to rise  
to take our way there as i you devise  
but natheless  while i have time and space  
ere that i farther in this tale pace  
me thinketh it accordant to reason  
to tell you alle the condition 
of each of them  so as it seemed me  
and which they weren  and of what degree  
and eke in what array that they were in  
and at a knight then will i first begin  
a knight there was  and that a worthy man  
that from the time that he first began 
to riden out  he loved chivalry  
truth and honour  freedom and courtesy  
full worthy was he in his lorde s war  
and thereto had he ridden  no man farre  
as well in christendom as in heatheness  
and ever honour d for his worthiness 
at alisandre he was when it was won  
full often time he had the board begun 
above alle nations in prusse  
in lettowe had he reysed  and in russe  
no christian man so oft of his degree  
in grenade at the siege eke had he be 
of algesir  and ridden in belmarie  
at leyes was he  and at satalie  
when they were won  and in the greate sea 
at many a noble army had he be  
at mortal battles had he been fifteen  
and foughten for our faith at tramissene  
in listes thries  and aye slain his foe  
this ilke worthy knight had been also 
some time with the lord of palatie  
against another heathen in turkie  
and evermore he had a sovereign price  
and though that he was worthy he was wise  high esteem  
and of his port as meek as is a maid  
he never yet no villainy ne said 
in all his life  unto no manner wight  
he was a very perfect gentle knight  
but for to telle you of his array  
his horse was good  but yet he was not gay  
of fustian he weared a gipon  
alle besmotter d with his habergeon  
for he was late y come from his voyage  
and wente for to do his pilgrimage  
with him there was his son  a younge squire  
a lover  and a lusty bacheler  
with lockes crulle as they were laid in press  
of twenty year of age he was i guess  
of his stature he was of even length  
and wonderly deliver  and great of strength  
and he had been some time in chevachie  
in flanders  in artois  and picardie  
and borne him well  as of so little space  
in hope to standen in his lady s grace  
embroider d was he  as it were a mead 
all full of freshe flowers  white and red  
singing he was  or fluting all the day  
he was as fresh as is the month of may  
short was his gown  with sleeves long and wide  
well could he sit on horse  and faire ride  
he coulde songes make  and well indite  
joust  and eke dance  and well pourtray and write  
so hot he loved  that by nightertale 
he slept no more than doth the nightingale  
courteous he was  lowly  and serviceable  
and carv d before his father at the table  
a yeoman had he  and servants no mo  
at that time  for him list ride so 
and he was clad in coat and hood of green  
a sheaf of peacock arrows bright and keen 
under his belt he bare full thriftily  
well could he dress his tackle yeomanly  
his arrows drooped not with feathers low  
and in his hand he bare a mighty bow  
a nut head had he  with a brown visiage  
of wood craft coud he well all the usage  
upon his arm he bare a gay bracer  
and by his side a sword and a buckler  
and on that other side a gay daggere  
harnessed well  and sharp as point of spear  
a christopher on his breast of silver sheen  
an horn he bare  the baldric was of green  
a forester was he soothly as i guess  
there was also a nun  a prioress  
that of her smiling was full simple and coy  
her greatest oathe was but by saint loy  
and she was cleped madame eglentine  
full well she sang the service divine  
entuned in her nose full seemly  
and french she spake full fair and fetisly 
after the school of stratford atte bow  
for french of paris was to her unknow  
at meate was she well y taught withal  
she let no morsel from her lippes fall  
nor wet her fingers in her sauce deep  
well could she carry a morsel  and well keep  
that no droppe ne fell upon her breast  
in courtesy was set full much her lest  
her over lippe wiped she so clean  
that in her cup there was no farthing seen 
of grease  when she drunken had her draught  
full seemely after her meat she raught  
and sickerly she was of great disport  
and full pleasant  and amiable of port  disposition 
and pained her to counterfeite cheer 
of court  and be estately of mannere  a courtly disposition 
and to be holden digne of reverence  
but for to speaken of her conscience  
she was so charitable and so pitous  
she woulde weep if that she saw a mouse 
caught in a trap  if it were dead or bled  
of smalle houndes had she  that she fed 
with roasted flesh  and milk  and wastel bread  
but sore she wept if one of them were dead  
or if men smote it with a yarde smart  
and all was conscience and tender heart  
full seemly her wimple y pinched was  
her nose tretis  her eyen gray as glass  
her mouth full small  and thereto soft and red  
but sickerly she had a fair forehead  
it was almost a spanne broad i trow  
for hardily she was not undergrow  
full fetis was her cloak  as i was ware  
of small coral about her arm she bare 
a pair of beades  gauded all with green  
and thereon hung a brooch of gold full sheen  
on which was first y written a crown d a  
and after  amor vincit omnia  
another nun also with her had she  
 that was her chapelleine  and priestes three   
a monk there was  a fair for the mast ry  
an out rider  that loved venery  
a manly man  to be an abbot able  
full many a dainty horse had he in stable  
and when he rode  men might his bridle hear 
jingeling in a whistling wind as clear  
and eke as loud  as doth the chapel bell  
there as this lord was keeper of the cell  
the rule of saint maur and of saint benet  
because that it was old and somedeal strait 
this ilke monk let olde thinges pace  
and held after the newe world the trace  
he gave not of the text a pulled hen 
that saith  that hunters be not holy men  for the text 
ne that a monk  when he is cloisterless  
is like to a fish that is waterless  
this is to say  a monk out of his cloister  
this ilke text held he not worth an oyster  
and i say his opinion was good  
why should he study  and make himselfe wood 
upon a book in cloister always pore  
or swinken with his handes  and labour  
as austin bid  how shall the world be served  
let austin have his swink to him reserved  
therefore he was a prickasour aright  
greyhounds he had as swift as fowl of flight  
of pricking and of hunting for the hare 
was all his lust  for no cost would he spare  
 i saw his sleeves purfil d at the hand 
with gris  and that the finest of the land  
and for to fasten his hood under his chin  
he had of gold y wrought a curious pin  
a love knot in the greater end there was  
his head was bald  and shone as any glass  
and eke his face  as it had been anoint  
he was a lord full fat and in good point  
his eyen steep  and rolling in his head  
that steamed as a furnace of a lead  
his bootes supple  his horse in great estate  
now certainly he was a fair prelate  
he was not pale as a forpined ghost  
a fat swan lov d he best of any roast  
his palfrey was as brown as is a berry  
a friar there was  a wanton and a merry  
a limitour  a full solemne man  
in all the orders four is none that can 
so much of dalliance and fair language  
he had y made full many a marriage 
of younge women  at his owen cost  
unto his order he was a noble post  
full well belov d  and familiar was he 
with franklins over all in his country  
and eke with worthy women of the town  
for he had power of confession  
as said himselfe  more than a curate  
for of his order he was licentiate  
full sweetely heard he confession  
and pleasant was his absolution  
he was an easy man to give penance  
there as he wist to have a good pittance  
for unto a poor order for to give get good payment 
is signe that a man is well y shrive  
for if he gave  he durste make avant  
he wiste that the man was repentant  
for many a man so hard is of his heart  
he may not weep although him sore smart  
therefore instead of weeping and prayeres  
men must give silver to the poore freres  
his tippet was aye farsed full of knives 
and pinnes  for to give to faire wives  
and certainly he had a merry note  
well could he sing and playen on a rote  
of yeddings he bare utterly the prize  
his neck was white as is the fleur de lis  
thereto he strong was as a champion  
and knew well the taverns in every town  
and every hosteler and gay tapstere  
better than a lazar or a beggere  
for unto such a worthy man as he 
accordeth not  as by his faculty  
to have with such lazars acquaintance  
it is not honest  it may not advance  
as for to deale with no such pouraille  
but all with rich  and sellers of vitaille  
and ov r all there as profit should arise  
courteous he was  and lowly of service  
there n as no man nowhere so virtuous  
he was the beste beggar in all his house  
and gave a certain farme for the grant  
none of his bretheren came in his haunt  
for though a widow hadde but one shoe  
so pleasant was his in principio  
yet would he have a farthing ere he went  
his purchase was well better than his rent  
and rage he could and play as any whelp  
in lovedays  there could he muchel help  
for there was he not like a cloisterer  
with threadbare cope as is a poor scholer  
but he was like a master or a pope  
of double worsted was his semicope  
that rounded was as a bell out of press  
somewhat he lisped for his wantonness  
to make his english sweet upon his tongue  
and in his harping  when that he had sung  
his eyen twinkled in his head aright  
as do the starres in a frosty night  
this worthy limitour was call d huberd  
a merchant was there with a forked beard  
in motley  and high on his horse he sat  
upon his head a flandrish beaver hat  
his bootes clasped fair and fetisly  
his reasons aye spake he full solemnly  
sounding alway th  increase of his winning  
he would the sea were kept for any thing 
betwixte middleburg and orewell 
well could he in exchange shieldes sell 
this worthy man full well his wit beset  
there wiste no wight that he was in debt  
so estately was he of governance 
with his bargains  and with his chevisance  
for sooth he was a worthy man withal  
but sooth to say  i n ot how men him call  
a clerk there was of oxenford also  
that unto logic hadde long y go  
as leane was his horse as is a rake  
and he was not right fat  i undertake  
but looked hollow  and thereto soberly  
full threadbare was his overest courtepy  
for he had gotten him yet no benefice  
ne was not worldly  to have an office  
for him was lever have at his bed s head 
twenty bookes  clothed in black or red  
of aristotle  and his philosophy  
than robes rich  or fiddle  or psalt ry  
but all be that he was a philosopher  
yet hadde he but little gold in coffer  
but all that he might of his friendes hent  
on bookes and on learning he it spent  
and busily gan for the soules pray 
of them that gave him wherewith to scholay 
of study took he moste care and heed  
not one word spake he more than was need  
and that was said in form and reverence  
and short and quick  and full of high sentence  
sounding in moral virtue was his speech  
and gladly would he learn  and gladly teach  
a sergeant of the law  wary and wise  
that often had y been at the parvis  
there was also  full rich of excellence  
discreet he was  and of great reverence  
he seemed such  his wordes were so wise  
justice he was full often in assize  
by patent  and by plein commission  
for his science  and for his high renown  
of fees and robes had he many one  
so great a purchaser was nowhere none  
all was fee simple to him  in effect 
his purchasing might not be in suspect 
nowhere so busy a man as he there was 
and yet he seemed busier than he was 
in termes had he case  and doomes all 
that from the time of king will  were fall  
thereto he could indite  and make a thing 
there coulde no wight pinch at his writing  
and every statute coud he plain by rote 
he rode but homely in a medley coat  
girt with a seint of silk  with barres small  
of his array tell i no longer tale  
a frankelin was in this company  
white was his beard  as is the daisy  
of his complexion he was sanguine  
well lov d he in the morn a sop in wine  
to liven in delight was ever his won  
for he was epicurus  owen son  
that held opinion  that plein delight 
was verily felicity perfite  
an householder  and that a great  was he  
saint julian he was in his country  
his bread  his ale  was alway after one  
a better envined man was nowhere none  
withoute bake meat never was his house  
of fish and flesh  and that so plenteous  
it snowed in his house of meat and drink  
of alle dainties that men coulde think  
after the sundry seasons of the year  
so changed he his meat and his soupere  
full many a fat partridge had he in mew  
and many a bream  and many a luce in stew 
woe was his cook  but if his sauce were 
poignant and sharp  and ready all his gear  
his table dormant in his hall alway 
stood ready cover d all the longe day  
at sessions there was he lord and sire  
full often time he was knight of the shire 
an anlace  and a gipciere all of silk  
hung at his girdle  white as morning milk  
a sheriff had he been  and a countour 
was nowhere such a worthy vavasour  
 an haberdasher  and a carpenter  
a webbe  a dyer  and a tapiser  
were with us eke  cloth d in one livery  
of a solemn and great fraternity  
full fresh and new their gear y picked was  
their knives were y chaped not with brass  
but all with silver wrought full clean and well  
their girdles and their pouches every deal  
well seemed each of them a fair burgess  
to sitten in a guild hall  on the dais  
evereach  for the wisdom that he can  
was shapely for to be an alderman  
for chattels hadde they enough and rent  
and eke their wives would it well assent  
and elles certain they had been to blame  
it is full fair to be y clep d madame  
and for to go to vigils all before  
and have a mantle royally y bore  
a cook they hadde with them for the nones  
to boil the chickens and the marrow bones  
and powder merchant tart and galingale  
well could he know a draught of london ale  
he could roast  and stew  and broil  and fry  
make mortrewes  and well bake a pie  
but great harm was it  as it thoughte me  
that  on his shin a mormal hadde he  
for blanc manger  that made he with the best 
a shipman was there  wonned far by west  
for ought i wot  be was of dartemouth  
he rode upon a rouncy  as he couth  
all in a gown of falding to the knee  
a dagger hanging by a lace had he 
about his neck under his arm adown  
the hot summer had made his hue all brown  
and certainly he was a good fellaw  
full many a draught of wine he had y draw 
from bourdeaux ward  while that the chapmen sleep  
of nice conscience took he no keep  
if that he fought  and had the higher hand  
by water he sent them home to every land  
but of his craft to reckon well his tides  prisoners 
his streames and his strandes him besides  
his herberow  his moon  and lodemanage  
there was none such  from hull unto carthage 
hardy he was  and wise  i undertake  
with many a tempest had his beard been shake  
he knew well all the havens  as they were  
from scotland to the cape of finisterre  
and every creek in bretagne and in spain  
his barge y cleped was the magdelain  
with us there was a doctor of physic  
in all this worlde was there none him like 
to speak of physic  and of surgery  
for he was grounded in astronomy  
he kept his patient a full great deal 
in houres by his magic natural  
well could he fortune the ascendent 
of his images for his patient   
he knew the cause of every malady  
were it of cold  or hot  or moist  or dry  
and where engender d  and of what humour  
he was a very perfect practisour 
the cause y know  and of his harm the root  
anon he gave to the sick man his boot 
full ready had he his apothecaries  
to send his drugges and his lectuaries 
for each of them made other for to win 
their friendship was not newe to begin 
well knew he the old esculapius  
and dioscorides  and eke rufus  
old hippocras  hali  and gallien  
serapion  rasis  and avicen  
averrois  damascene  and constantin  
bernard  and gatisden  and gilbertin  
of his diet measurable was he  
for it was of no superfluity  
but of great nourishing  and digestible  
his study was but little on the bible  
in sanguine and in perse he clad was all 
lined with taffeta  and with sendall  
and yet he was but easy of dispense  
he kept that he won in the pestilence  
for gold in physic is a cordial  during the plague 
therefore he loved gold in special  
a good wife was there of beside bath  
but she was somedeal deaf  and that was scath  
of cloth making she hadde such an haunt  
she passed them of ypres  and of gaunt  
in all the parish wife was there none  
that to the off ring before her should gon  
and if there did  certain so wroth was she  
that she was out of alle charity 
her coverchiefs were full fine of ground 
i durste swear  they weighede ten pound 
that on the sunday were upon her head  
her hosen weren of fine scarlet red  
full strait y tied  and shoes full moist and new 
bold was her face  and fair and red of hue  
she was a worthy woman all her live  
husbands at the church door had she had five  
withouten other company in youth  
but thereof needeth not to speak as nouth  
and thrice had she been at jerusalem  
she hadde passed many a strange stream 
at rome she had been  and at bologne  
in galice at saint james  and at cologne  
she coude much of wand rng by the way  
gat toothed was she  soothly for to say  
upon an ambler easily she sat  
y wimpled well  and on her head an hat 
as broad as is a buckler or a targe  
a foot mantle about her hippes large  
and on her feet a pair of spurres sharp  
in fellowship well could she laugh and carp 
of remedies of love she knew perchance 
for of that art she coud the olde dance  
a good man there was of religion  
that was a poore parson of a town  
but rich he was of holy thought and werk  
he was also a learned man  a clerk  
that christe s gospel truly woulde preach  
his parishens devoutly would he teach  
benign he was  and wonder diligent  
and in adversity full patient  
and such he was y proved often sithes  
full loth were him to curse for his tithes  
but rather would he given out of doubt  
unto his poore parishens about  
of his off ring  and eke of his substance  
he could in little thing have suffisance  
wide was his parish  and houses far asunder  very littl 
but he ne left not  for no rain nor thunder  
in sickness and in mischief to visit 
the farthest in his parish  much and lit  
upon his feet  and in his hand a staff  
this noble ensample to his sheep he gaf  
that first he wrought  and afterward he taught  
out of the gospel he the wordes caught  
and this figure he added yet thereto  
that if gold ruste  what should iron do  
for if a priest be foul  on whom we trust  
no wonder is a lewed man to rust  
and shame it is  if that a priest take keep  
to see a shitten shepherd and clean sheep  
well ought a priest ensample for to give  
by his own cleanness  how his sheep should live  
he sette not his benefice to hire  
and left his sheep eucumber d in the mire  
and ran unto london  unto saint paul s  
to seeke him a chantery for souls  
or with a brotherhood to be withold  
but dwelt at home  and kepte well his fold  
so that the wolf ne made it not miscarry  
he was a shepherd  and no mercenary  
and though he holy were  and virtuous  
he was to sinful men not dispitous 
nor of his speeche dangerous nor dign 
but in his teaching discreet and benign  
to drawen folk to heaven  with fairness  
by good ensample  was his business  
but it were any person obstinate  
what so he were of high or low estate  
him would he snibbe sharply for the nones  
a better priest i trow that nowhere none is  
he waited after no pomp nor reverence  
nor maked him a spiced conscience  
but christe s lore  and his apostles  twelve  
he taught  and first he follow d it himselve  
with him there was a ploughman  was his brother  
that had y laid of dung full many a fother  
a true swinker and a good was he  
living in peace and perfect charity  
god loved he beste with all his heart 
at alle times  were it gain or smart  
and then his neighebour right as himselve  
he woulde thresh  and thereto dike  and delve  
for christe s sake  for every poore wight  
withouten hire  if it lay in his might  
his tithes payed he full fair and well  
both of his proper swink  and his chattel 
in a tabard he rode upon a mare  
there was also a reeve  and a millere  
a sompnour  and a pardoner also  
a manciple  and myself  there were no mo   
the miller was a stout carle for the nones  
full big he was of brawn  and eke of bones  
that proved well  for ov r all where he came  
at wrestling he would bear away the ram  
he was short shouldered  broad  a thicke gnarr  
there was no door  that he n old heave off bar  
or break it at a running with his head  
his beard as any sow or fox was red  
and thereto broad  as though it were a spade  
upon the cop right of his nose he had 
a wart  and thereon stood a tuft of hairs 
red as the bristles of a sowe s ears  
his nose thirles blacke were and wide  
a sword and buckler bare he by his side  
his mouth as wide was as a furnace  
he was a jangler  and a goliardais  
and that was most of sin and harlotries  
well could he steale corn  and tolle thrice 
and yet he had a thumb of gold  pardie  
a white coat and a blue hood weared he 
a baggepipe well could he blow and soun   
and therewithal he brought us out of town  
a gentle manciple was there of a temple  
of which achatours mighte take ensample 
for to be wise in buying of vitaille  
for whether that he paid  or took by taile  
algate he waited so in his achate  
that he was aye before in good estate  
now is not that of god a full fair grace 
that such a lewed mannes wit shall pace 
the wisdom of an heap of learned men  
of masters had he more than thries ten  
that were of law expert and curious  
of which there was a dozen in that house  
worthy to be stewards of rent and land 
of any lord that is in engleland  
to make him live by his proper good  
in honour debtless  but if he were wood  
or live as scarcely as him list desire  
and able for to helpen all a shire 
in any case that mighte fall or hap  
and yet this manciple set their aller cap 
the reeve was a slender choleric man 
his beard was shav d as nigh as ever he can  
his hair was by his eares round y shorn  
his top was docked like a priest beforn 
full longe were his legges  and full lean 
y like a staff  there was no calf y seen 
well could he keep a garner and a bin 
there was no auditor could on him win 
well wist he by the drought  and by the rain  
the yielding of his seed and of his grain 
his lorde s sheep  his neat  and his dairy 
his swine  his horse  his store  and his poultry  
were wholly in this reeve s governing  
and by his cov nant gave he reckoning  
since that his lord was twenty year of age  
there could no man bring him in arrearage 
there was no bailiff  herd  nor other hine 
that he ne knew his sleight and his covine 
they were adrad of him  as of the death 
his wonning was full fair upon an heath 
with greene trees y shadow d was his place  
he coulde better than his lord purchase 
full rich he was y stored privily 
his lord well could he please subtilly  
to give and lend him of his owen good  
and have a thank  and yet a coat and hood  
in youth he learned had a good mistere 
he was a well good wright  a carpentere 
this reeve sate upon a right good stot 
that was all pomely gray  and highte scot  
a long surcoat of perse upon he had  
and by his side he bare a rusty blade  
of norfolk was this reeve  of which i tell  
beside a town men clepen baldeswell  
tucked he was  as is a friar  about  
and ever rode the hinderest of the rout  
a sompnour was there with us in that place  
that had a fire red cherubinnes face  
for sausefleme he was  with eyen narrow  
as hot he was and lecherous as a sparrow  
with scalled browes black  and pilled beard  
of his visage children were sore afeard  
there n as quicksilver  litharge  nor brimstone  
boras  ceruse  nor oil of tartar none  
nor ointement that woulde cleanse or bite  
that him might helpen of his whelkes white  
nor of the knobbes sitting on his cheeks  
well lov d he garlic  onions  and leeks  
and for to drink strong wine as red as blood  
then would he speak  and cry as he were wood  
and when that he well drunken had the wine  
then would he speake no word but latin  
a fewe termes knew he  two or three  
that he had learned out of some decree  
no wonder is  he heard it all the day  
and eke ye knowen well  how that a jay 
can clepen  wat   as well as can the pope  
but whoso would in other thing him grope  
then had he spent all his philosophy  
aye  questio quid juris  would he cry  
he was a gentle harlot and a kind  
a better fellow should a man not find  
he woulde suffer  for a quart of wine  
a good fellow to have his concubine 
a twelvemonth  and excuse him at the full  
full privily a finch eke could he pull  
and if he found owhere a good fellaw  
he woulde teache him to have none awe 
in such a case of the archdeacon s curse  
but if a manne s soul were in his purse  
for in his purse he should y punished be  
 purse is the archedeacon s hell   said he  
but well i wot  he lied right indeed  
of cursing ought each guilty man to dread  
for curse will slay right as assoiling saveth  
and also  ware him of a significavit  
in danger had he at his owen guise 
the younge girles of the diocese  
and knew their counsel  and was of their rede  
a garland had he set upon his head  
as great as it were for an alestake  
a buckler had he made him of a cake  
with him there rode a gentle pardonere 
of ronceval  his friend and his compere  
that straight was comen from the court of rome  
full loud he sang   come hither  love  to me  
this sompnour bare to him a stiff burdoun  
was never trump of half so great a soun   
this pardoner had hair as yellow as wax  
but smooth it hung  as doth a strike of flax  
by ounces hung his lockes that he had  
and therewith he his shoulders oversprad  
full thin it lay  by culpons one and one  
but hood for jollity  he weared none  
for it was trussed up in his wallet  
him thought he rode all of the newe get  
dishevel  save his cap  he rode all bare  
such glaring eyen had he  as an hare  
a vernicle had he sew d upon his cap  
his wallet lay before him in his lap  
bretful of pardon come from rome all hot  
a voice he had as small as hath a goat  
no beard had he  nor ever one should have  
as smooth it was as it were new y shave  
i trow he were a gelding or a mare  
but of his craft  from berwick unto ware  
ne was there such another pardonere  
for in his mail he had a pillowbere  
which  as he saide  was our lady s veil  
he said  he had a gobbet of the sail 
that sainte peter had  when that he went 
upon the sea  till jesus christ him hent  
he had a cross of latoun full of stones  
and in a glass he hadde pigge s bones  
but with these relics  whenne that he fond 
a poore parson dwelling upon lond  
upon a day he got him more money 
than that the parson got in moneths tway  
and thus with feigned flattering and japes  
he made the parson and the people his apes  
but truely to tellen at the last  
he was in church a noble ecclesiast  
well could he read a lesson or a story  
but alderbest he sang an offertory  
for well he wiste  when that song was sung  
he muste preach  and well afile his tongue  
to winne silver  as he right well could  
therefore he sang full merrily and loud  
now have i told you shortly in a clause 
th  estate  th  array  the number  and eke the cause 
why that assembled was this company 
in southwark at this gentle hostelry  
that highte the tabard  fast by the bell  
but now is time to you for to tell 
how that we baren us that ilke night  
when we were in that hostelry alight  
and after will i tell of our voyage  
and all the remnant of our pilgrimage  
but first i pray you of your courtesy  
that ye arette it not my villainy  
though that i plainly speak in this mattere  
to tellen you their wordes and their cheer  
not though i speak their wordes properly  
for this ye knowen all so well as i  
whoso shall tell a tale after a man  
he must rehearse  as nigh as ever he can  
every word  if it be in his charge  
all speak he ne er so rudely and so large  
or elles he must tell his tale untrue  
or feigne things  or finde wordes new  
he may not spare  although he were his brother  
he must as well say one word as another  
christ spake himself full broad in holy writ  
and well ye wot no villainy is it  
eke plato saith  whoso that can him read  
the wordes must be cousin to the deed  
also i pray you to forgive it me  
all have i not set folk in their degree  
here in this tale  as that they shoulden stand  
my wit is short  ye may well understand  
great cheere made our host us every one  
and to the supper set he us anon  
and served us with victual of the best  
strong was the wine  and well to drink us lest  
a seemly man our hoste was withal 
for to have been a marshal in an hall  
a large man he was with eyen steep  
a fairer burgess is there none in cheap  
bold of his speech  and wise and well y taught  
and of manhoode lacked him right naught  
eke thereto was he right a merry man  
and after supper playen he began  
and spake of mirth amonges other things  
when that we hadde made our reckonings  
and saide thus   now  lordinges  truly

and if you liketh all by one assent 
now for to standen at my judgement  
and for to worken as i shall you say 
to morrow  when ye riden on the way  
now by my father s soule that is dead  
but ye be merry  smiteth off mine head  
hold up your hands withoute more speech  
our counsel was not longe for to seech  
us thought it was not worth to make it wise  
and granted him withoute more avise  
and bade him say his verdict  as him lest  
lordings quoth he  now hearken for the best  
but take it not  i pray you  in disdain  
this is the point  to speak it plat and plain  
that each of you  to shorten with your way 
in this voyage  shall tellen tales tway  
to canterbury ward  i mean it so  
and homeward he shall tellen other two  
of aventures that whilom have befall  
and which of you that bear th him best of all  
that is to say  that telleth in this case 
tales of best sentence and most solace  
shall have a supper at your aller cost 
here in this place  sitting by this post  
when that ye come again from canterbury  
and for to make you the more merry  
i will myselfe gladly with you ride  
right at mine owen cost  and be your guide  
and whoso will my judgement withsay  
shall pay for all we spenden by the way  
and if ye vouchesafe that it be so  
tell me anon withoute wordes mo   
and i will early shape me therefore   
this thing was granted  and our oath we swore 
with full glad heart  and prayed him also  
that he would vouchesafe for to do so  
and that he woulde be our governour  
and of our tales judge and reportour  
and set a supper at a certain price  
and we will ruled be at his device  
in high and low  and thus by one assent  
we be accorded to his judgement  
and thereupon the wine was fet anon  
we drunken  and to reste went each one  
withouten any longer tarrying 
a morrow  when the day began to spring  
up rose our host  and was our aller cock  
and gather d us together in a flock  
and forth we ridden all a little space  
unto the watering of saint thomas  
and there our host began his horse arrest  
and saide   lordes  hearken if you lest  
ye weet your forword  and i it record  
if even song and morning song accord

come near quoth he  my lady prioress  
and ye  sir clerk  let be your shamefastness  
nor study not  lay hand to  every man   
anon to drawen every wight began  
and shortly for to tellen as it was  
were it by a venture  or sort  or cas  
the sooth is this  the cut fell to the knight  
of which full blithe and glad was every wight  
and tell he must his tale as was reason  
by forword  and by composition  
as ye have heard  what needeth wordes mo   
and when this good man saw that it was so  
as he that wise was and obedient 
to keep his forword by his free assent  
he said   sithen i shall begin this game  
why  welcome be the cut in godde s name  
now let us ride  and hearken what i say   
and with that word we ridden forth our way  
and he began with right a merry cheer 
his tale anon  and said as ye shall hear  
 
the knight s tale 
 
whilom  as olde stories tellen us  
there was a duke that highte theseus  
of athens he was lord and governor  
and in his time such a conqueror 
that greater was there none under the sun  
full many a riche country had he won  
what with his wisdom and his chivalry  
he conquer d all the regne of feminie  
that whilom was y cleped scythia  
and weddede the queen hippolyta 
and brought her home with him to his country 
with muchel glory and great solemnity  
and eke her younge sister emily  
and thus with vict ry and with melody 
let i this worthy duke to athens ride  
and all his host  in armes him beside  
and certes  if it n ere too long to hear  
i would have told you fully the mannere  
how wonnen was the regne of feminie  
by theseus  and by his chivalry  
and of the greate battle for the nonce 
betwixt athenes and the amazons  
and how assieged was hippolyta  
the faire hardy queen of scythia  
and of the feast that was at her wedding 
and of the tempest at her homecoming  
but all these things i must as now forbear  
i have  god wot  a large field to ear  
and weake be the oxen in my plough  
the remnant of my tale is long enow  
i will not letten eke none of this rout  
let every fellow tell his tale about  this company 
and let see now who shall the supper win  
there as i left  i will again begin  
this duke  of whom i make mentioun  
when he was come almost unto the town  
in all his weal  and in his moste pride  
he was ware  as he cast his eye aside  
where that there kneeled in the highe way 
a company of ladies  tway and tway  
each after other  clad in clothes black  
but such a cry and such a woe they make  
that in this world n is creature living  
that hearde such another waimenting 
and of this crying would they never stenten  
till they the reines of his bridle henten  
 what folk be ye that at mine homecoming 
perturben so my feaste with crying   
quoth theseus   have ye so great envy 
of mine honour  that thus complain and cry  
or who hath you misboden  or offended  
do telle me  if it may be amended  
and why that ye be clad thus all in black   
the oldest lady of them all then spake  
when she had swooned  with a deadly cheer  
that it was ruthe for to see or hear  
she saide   lord  to whom fortune hath given 
vict ry  and as a conqueror to liven  
nought grieveth us your glory and your honour  
but we beseechen mercy and succour  
have mercy on our woe and our distress  
some drop of pity  through thy gentleness  
upon us wretched women let now fall  
for certes  lord  there is none of us all 
that hath not been a duchess or a queen  
now be we caitives  as it is well seen  
thanked be fortune  and her false wheel  
that none estate ensureth to be wele  
and certes  lord  t abiden your presence prosperous estate 
here in this temple of the goddess clemence 
we have been waiting all this fortenight  
now help us  lord  since it lies in thy might  
 i  wretched wight  that weep and waile thus  
was whilom wife to king capaneus  
that starf at thebes  cursed be that day  
and alle we that be in this array  
and maken all this lamentatioun  
we losten all our husbands at that town  
while that the siege thereabouten lay  
and yet the olde creon  wellaway  
that lord is now of thebes the city  
fulfilled of ire and of iniquity  
he for despite  and for his tyranny  
to do the deade bodies villainy  
of all our lorde s  which that been y slaw  
hath all the bodies on an heap y draw  
and will not suffer them by none assent 
neither to be y buried  nor y brent  
but maketh houndes eat them in despite   
and with that word  withoute more respite 
they fallen groff  and cryden piteously  
 have on us wretched women some mercy  
and let our sorrow sinken in thine heart   
this gentle duke down from his courser start 
with hearte piteous  when he heard them speak  
him thoughte that his heart would all to break  
when he saw them so piteous and so mate 
that whilom weren of so great estate  
and in his armes he them all up hent  
and them comforted in full good intent  
and swore his oath  as he was true knight  
he woulde do so farforthly his might 
upon the tyrant creon them to wreak  
that all the people of greece shoulde speak  
how creon was of theseus y served  
as he that had his death full well deserved  
and right anon withoute more abode 
his banner he display d  and forth he rode 
to thebes ward  and all his  host beside  
no ner athenes would he go nor ride  
nor take his ease fully half a day  
but onward on his way that night he lay  
and sent anon hippolyta the queen  
and emily her younge sister sheen 
unto the town of athens for to dwell  
and forth he rit  there is no more to tell  
the red statue of mars with spear and targe 
so shineth in his white banner large 
that all the fieldes glitter up and down  
and by his banner borne is his pennon 
of gold full rich  in which there was y beat 
the minotaur which that he slew in crete 
thus rit this duke  thus rit this conqueror 
and in his host of chivalry the flower  
till that he came to thebes  and alight 
fair in a field  there as he thought to fight  
but shortly for to speaken of this thing  
with creon  which that was of thebes king  
he fought  and slew him manly as a knight 
in plain bataille  and put his folk to flight  
and by assault he won the city after  
and rent adown both wall  and spar  and rafter  
and to the ladies he restored again 
the bodies of their husbands that were slain  
to do obsequies  as was then the guise  
but it were all too long for to devise 
the greate clamour  and the waimenting  
which that the ladies made at the brenning 
of the bodies  and the great honour 
that theseus the noble conqueror 
did to the ladies  when they from him went  
but shortly for to tell is mine intent  
when that this worthy duke  this theseus  
had creon slain  and wonnen thebes thus  
still in the field he took all night his rest  
and did with all the country as him lest  
to ransack in the tas of bodies dead  
them for to strip of harness and of weed  
the pillers did their business and cure  
after the battle and discomfiture  
and so befell  that in the tas they found  
through girt with many a grievous bloody wound  
two younge knightes ligging by and by 
both in one armes  wrought full richely  
of whiche two  arcita hight that one  
and he that other highte palamon  
not fully quick  nor fully dead they were  
but by their coat armour  and by their gear  
the heralds knew them well in special  
as those that weren of the blood royal 
of thebes  and of sistren two y born  
out of the tas the pillers have them torn  
and have them carried soft unto the tent 
of theseus  and he full soon them sent 
to athens  for to dwellen in prison 
perpetually  he n olde no ranson  
and when this worthy duke had thus y done  
he took his host  and home he rit anon 
with laurel crowned as a conquerour  
and there he lived in joy and in honour 
term of his life  what needeth wordes mo   
and in a tower  in anguish and in woe  
dwellen this palamon  and eke arcite  
for evermore  there may no gold them quite 
thus passed year by year  and day by day  
till it fell ones in a morn of may 
that emily  that fairer was to seen 
than is the lily upon his stalke green  
and fresher than the may with flowers new 
for with the rose colour strove her hue  
i n ot which was the finer of them two  
ere it was day  as she was wont to do  
she was arisen  and all ready dight  
for may will have no sluggardy a night  
the season pricketh every gentle heart  
and maketh him out of his sleep to start  
and saith   arise  and do thine observance   
this maketh emily have remembrance 
to do honour to may  and for to rise  
y clothed was she fresh for to devise  
her yellow hair was braided in a tress  
behind her back  a yarde long i guess  
and in the garden at the sun uprist 
she walketh up and down where as her list  
she gathereth flowers  party white and red  
to make a sotel garland for her head  
and as an angel heavenly she sung  
the greate tower  that was so thick and strong  
which of the castle was the chief dungeon 
where as these knightes weren in prison  
of which i tolde you  and telle shall  
was even joinant to the garden wall  
there as this emily had her playing  
bright was the sun  and clear that morrowning  
and palamon  this woful prisoner  
as was his wont  by leave of his gaoler  
was ris n  and roamed in a chamber on high  
in which he all the noble city sigh  
and eke the garden  full of branches green  
there as this fresh emelia the sheen 
was in her walk  and roamed up and down  
this sorrowful prisoner  this palamon 
went in his chamber roaming to and fro  
and to himself complaining of his woe  
that he was born  full oft he said  alas  
and so befell  by aventure or cas  
that through a window thick of many a bar 
of iron great  and square as any spar  
he cast his eyes upon emelia  
and therewithal he blent and cried  ah  
as though he stungen were unto the heart  
and with that cry arcite anon up start  
and saide   cousin mine  what aileth thee  
that art so pale and deadly for to see  
why cried st thou  who hath thee done offence  
for godde s love  take all in patience 
our prison  for it may none other be  
fortune hath giv n us this adversity   
some wick  aspect or disposition 
of saturn  by some constellation  
hath giv n us this  although we had it sworn  
so stood the heaven when that we were born  
we must endure  this is the short and plain  
this palamon answer d  and said again  
 cousin  forsooth of this opinion 
thou hast a vain imagination  
this prison caused me not for to cry  
but i was hurt right now thorough mine eye 
into mine heart  that will my bane be  
the fairness of the lady that i see 
yond in the garden roaming to and fro  
is cause of all my crying and my woe  
i n ot wher she be woman or goddess  
but venus is it  soothly as i guess  
and therewithal on knees adown he fill  
and saide   venus  if it be your will 
you in this garden thus to transfigure 
before me sorrowful wretched creature  
out of this prison help that we may scape  
and if so be our destiny be shape 
by etern word to dien in prison  
of our lineage have some compassion  
that is so low y brought by tyranny   
and with that word arcita gan espy 
where as this lady roamed to and fro 
and with that sight her beauty hurt him so  
that if that palamon was wounded sore  
arcite is hurt as much as he  or more  
and with a sigh he saide piteously  
 the freshe beauty slay th me suddenly 
of her that roameth yonder in the place  
and but i have her mercy and her grace  
that i may see her at the leaste way  
i am but dead  there is no more to say   
this palamon  when he these wordes heard  
dispiteously he looked  and answer d  
 whether say st thou this in earnest or in play   
 nay   quoth arcite   in earnest  by my fay  
god help me so  me lust full ill to play   
this palamon gan knit his browes tway  
 it were   quoth he   to thee no great honour 
for to be false  nor for to be traitour 
to me  that am thy cousin and thy brother 
y sworn full deep  and each of us to other  
that never for to dien in the pain  
till that the death departen shall us twain  
neither of us in love to hinder other  
nor in none other case  my leve brother  
but that thou shouldest truly farther me 
in every case  as i should farther thee  
this was thine oath  and mine also certain  
i wot it well  thou dar st it not withsayn  
thus art thou of my counsel out of doubt  
and now thou wouldest falsely be about 
to love my lady  whom i love and serve  
and ever shall  until mine hearte sterve 
now certes  false arcite  thou shalt not so 
i lov d her first  and tolde thee my woe 
as to my counsel  and my brother sworn 
to farther me  as i have told beforn  
for which thou art y bounden as a knight 
to helpe me  if it lie in thy might  
or elles art thou false  i dare well sayn   
this arcita full proudly spake again  
 thou shalt   quoth he   be rather false than i  
and thou art false  i tell thee utterly  
for par amour i lov d her first ere thou  
what wilt thou say  thou wist it not right now 
whether she be a woman or goddess  
thine is affection of holiness  
and mine is love  as to a creature  
for which i tolde thee mine aventure 
as to my cousin  and my brother sworn 
i pose  that thou loved st her beforn  
wost thou not well the olde clerke s saw  
that who shall give a lover any law  
love is a greater lawe  by my pan  
than may be giv n to any earthly man  
therefore positive law  and such decree  
is broke alway for love in each degree 
a man must needes love  maugre his head  
he may not flee it  though he should be dead  
all be she maid  or widow  or else wife  
and eke it is not likely all thy life 
to standen in her grace  no more than i 
for well thou wost thyselfe verily  
that thou and i be damned to prison 
perpetual  us gaineth no ranson  
we strive  as did the houndes for the bone  
they fought all day  and yet their part was none  
there came a kite  while that they were so wroth  
and bare away the bone betwixt them both  
and therefore at the kinge s court  my brother  
each man for himselfe  there is no other  
love if thee list  for i love and aye shall 
and soothly  leve brother  this is all  
here in this prison musten we endure  
and each of us take his aventure   
great was the strife and long between these tway  
if that i hadde leisure for to say  
but to the effect  it happen d on a day 
to tell it you as shortly as i may  
a worthy duke that hight perithous 
that fellow was to the duke theseus 
since thilke day that they were children lite 
was come to athens  his fellow to visite  
and for to play  as he was wont to do  
for in this world he loved no man so  
and he lov d him as tenderly again  
so well they lov d  as olde bookes sayn  
that when that one was dead  soothly to sayn  
his fellow went and sought him down in hell  
but of that story list me not to write  
duke perithous loved well arcite  
and had him known at thebes year by year  
and finally at request and prayere 
of perithous  withoute ranson 
duke theseus him let out of prison  
freely to go  where him list over all  
in such a guise  as i you tellen shall 
this was the forword  plainly to indite  
betwixte theseus and him arcite  
that if so were  that arcite were y found 
ever in his life  by day or night  one stound 
in any country of this theseus  
and he were caught  it was accorded thus  
that with a sword he shoulde lose his head  
there was none other remedy nor rede  
but took his leave  and homeward he him sped  
let him beware  his necke lieth to wed  
how great a sorrow suff reth now arcite  
the death he feeleth through his hearte smite  
he weepeth  waileth  crieth piteously  
to slay himself he waiteth privily  
he said   alas the day that i was born  
now is my prison worse than beforn  
now is me shape eternally to dwell 
not in purgatory  but right in hell  
alas  that ever i knew perithous  
for elles had i dwelt with theseus 
y fettered in his prison evermo   
then had i been in bliss  and not in woe  
only the sight of her  whom that i serve  
though that i never may her grace deserve  
would have sufficed right enough for me  
o deare cousin palamon   quoth he  
 thine is the vict ry of this aventure  
full blissfully in prison to endure  
in prison  nay certes  in paradise  
well hath fortune y turned thee the dice  
that hast the sight of her  and i th  absence  
for possible is  since thou hast her presence  
and art a knight  a worthy and an able  
that by some cas  since fortune is changeable  
thou may st to thy desire sometime attain  
but i that am exiled  and barren 
of alle grace  and in so great despair  
that there n is earthe  water  fire  nor air  
nor creature  that of them maked is  
that may me helpe nor comfort in this  
well ought i sterve in wanhope and distress  
farewell my life  my lust  and my gladness  
alas  why plainen men so in commune 
of purveyance of god  or of fortune  of god s providence  
that giveth them full oft in many a guise 
well better than they can themselves devise  
some man desireth for to have richess  
that cause is of his murder or great sickness  
and some man would out of his prison fain  
that in his house is of his meinie slain  
infinite harmes be in this mattere  
we wot never what thing we pray for here  
we fare as he that drunk is as a mouse  
a drunken man wot well he hath an house  
but he wot not which is the right way thither  
and to a drunken man the way is slither  
and certes in this world so fare we  
we seeke fast after felicity  
but we go wrong full often truely  
thus we may sayen all  and namely i  
that ween d  and had a great opinion  
that if i might escape from prison 
then had i been in joy and perfect heal  
where now i am exiled from my weal  
since that i may not see you  emily  
i am but dead  there is no remedy   
upon that other side  palamon  
when that he wist arcita was agone  
much sorrow maketh  that the greate tower 
resounded of his yelling and clamour 
the pure fetters on his shinnes great 
were of his bitter salte teares wet  
 alas   quoth he   arcita  cousin mine  
of all our strife  god wot  the fruit is thine  
thou walkest now in thebes at thy large  
and of my woe thou givest little charge  
thou mayst  since thou hast wisdom and manhead  
assemble all the folk of our kindred  
and make a war so sharp on this country 
that by some aventure  or some treaty  
thou mayst have her to lady and to wife  
for whom that i must needes lose my life  
for as by way of possibility  
since thou art at thy large  of prison free  
and art a lord  great is thine avantage  
more than is mine  that sterve here in a cage  
for i must weep and wail  while that i live  
with all the woe that prison may me give  
and eke with pain that love me gives also  
that doubles all my torment and my woe   
therewith the fire of jealousy upstart 
within his breast  and hent him by the heart 
so woodly  that he like was to behold 
the box tree  or the ashes dead and cold  
then said   o cruel goddess  that govern 
this world with binding of your word etern 
and writen in the table of adamant 
your parlement and your eternal grant  
what is mankind more unto you y hold 
than is the sheep  that rouketh in the fold  
for slain is man  right as another beast  
and dwelleth eke in prison and arrest  
and hath sickness  and great adversity  
and oftentimes guilteless  pardie 
what governance is in your prescience  
that guilteless tormenteth innocence  
and yet increaseth this all my penance  
that man is bounden to his observance 
for godde s sake to letten of his will  
whereas a beast may all his lust fulfil  
and when a beast is dead  he hath no pain  
but man after his death must weep and plain  
though in this worlde he have care and woe  
withoute doubt it maye standen so  
 the answer of this leave i to divines  
but well i wot  that in this world great pine is  
alas  i see a serpent or a thief 
that many a true man hath done mischief  
go at his large  and where him list may turn  
but i must be in prison through saturn  
and eke through juno  jealous and eke wood  
that hath well nigh destroyed all the blood 
of thebes  with his waste walles wide  
and venus slay th me on that other side 
for jealousy  and fear of him  arcite   
now will i stent of palamon a lite  
and let him in his prison stille dwell  
and of arcita forth i will you tell  
the summer passeth  and the nightes long 
increase double wise the paines strong 
both of the lover and the prisonere  
i n ot which hath the wofuller mistere  
for  shortly for to say  this palamon 
perpetually is damned to prison  
in chaines and in fetters to be dead  
and arcite is exiled on his head 
for evermore as out of that country  
nor never more he shall his lady see  
you lovers ask i now this question  
who lieth the worse  arcite or palamon  
the one may see his lady day by day  
but in prison he dwelle must alway  
the other where him list may ride or go  
but see his lady shall he never mo   
now deem all as you liste  ye that can  
for i will tell you forth as i began  
when that arcite to thebes comen was  
full oft a day he swelt  and said   alas   
for see this lady he shall never mo   
and shortly to concluden all his woe  
so much sorrow had never creature 
that is or shall be while the world may dure  
his sleep  his meat  his drink is him byraft  
that lean he wex  and dry as any shaft  
his eyen hollow  grisly to behold  
his hue sallow  and pale as ashes cold  
and solitary he was  ever alone  
and wailing all the night  making his moan  
and if he hearde song or instrument  
then would he weepen  he might not be stent  
so feeble were his spirits  and so low  
and changed so  that no man coulde know 
his speech  neither his voice  though men it heard  
and in his gear for all the world he far d 
not only like the lovers  malady 
of eros  but rather y like manie 
engender d of humours melancholic  
before his head in his cell fantastic  
and shortly turned was all upside down  
both habit and eke dispositioun  
of him  this woful lover dan arcite  
why should i all day of his woe indite  
when he endured had a year or two 
this cruel torment  and this pain and woe  
at thebes  in his country  as i said  
upon a night in sleep as he him laid  
him thought how that the winged god mercury 
before him stood  and bade him to be merry  
his sleepy yard in hand he bare upright  
a hat he wore upon his haires bright  
arrayed was this god as he took keep 
as he was when that argus took his sleep  
and said him thus   to athens shalt thou wend  
there is thee shapen of thy woe an end   
and with that word arcite woke and start  
 now truely how sore that e er me smart   
quoth he   to athens right now will i fare  
nor for no dread of death shall i not spare 
to see my lady that i love and serve  
in her presence i recke not to sterve   
and with that word he caught a great mirror  
and saw that changed was all his colour  
and saw his visage all in other kind  
and right anon it ran him ill his mind  
that since his face was so disfigur d 
of malady the which he had endur d  
he mighte well  if that he bare him low  
live in athenes evermore unknow  
and see his lady wellnigh day by day  
and right anon he changed his array  
and clad him as a poore labourer  
and all alone  save only a squier  
that knew his privity and all his cas  
which was disguised poorly as he was  
to athens is he gone the nexte way  
and to the court he went upon a day  
and at the gate he proffer d his service  
to drudge and draw  what so men would devise  
and  shortly of this matter for to sayn  
he fell in office with a chamberlain  
the which that dwelling was with emily  
for he was wise  and coulde soon espy 
of every servant which that served her  
well could he hewe wood  and water bear  
for he was young and mighty for the nones  
and thereto he was strong and big of bones 
to do that any wight can him devise  
a year or two he was in this service  
page of the chamber of emily the bright  
and philostrate he saide that he hight  
but half so well belov d a man as he 
ne was there never in court of his degree  
he was so gentle of conditioun  
that throughout all the court was his renown  
they saide that it were a charity 
that theseus would enhance his degree  
and put him in some worshipful service  
there as he might his virtue exercise  
and thus within a while his name sprung 
both of his deedes  and of his good tongue  
that theseus hath taken him so near  
that of his chamber he hath made him squire  
and gave him gold to maintain his degree  
and eke men brought him out of his country 
from year to year full privily his rent  
but honestly and slyly he it spent  
that no man wonder d how that he it had  
and three year in this wise his life be lad  
and bare him so in peace and eke in werre  
there was no man that theseus had so derre  
and in this blisse leave i now arcite  
and speak i will of palamon a lite  
in darkness horrible  and strong prison  
this seven year hath sitten palamon  
forpined  what for love  and for distress  
who feeleth double sorrow and heaviness 
but palamon  that love distraineth so  
that wood out of his wits he went for woe  
and eke thereto he is a prisonere 
perpetual  not only for a year  
who coulde rhyme in english properly 
his martyrdom  forsooth  it is not i  
therefore i pass as lightly as i may  
it fell that in the seventh year  in may 
the thirde night as olde bookes sayn  
that all this story tellen more plain  
were it by a venture or destiny 
as when a thing is shapen it shall be  
that soon after the midnight  palamon 
by helping of a friend brake his prison  
and fled the city fast as he might go  
for he had given drink his gaoler so 
of a clary  made of a certain wine  
with narcotise and opie of thebes fine  
that all the night  though that men would him shake  
the gaoler slept  he mighte not awake  
and thus he fled as fast as ever he may  
the night was short  and faste by the day 
that needes cast he must himself to hide  
and to a grove faste there beside he must cast about  or contrive  
with dreadful foot then stalked palamon  
for shortly this was his opinion  
that in the grove he would him hide all day  
and in the night then would he take his way 
to thebes ward  his friendes for to pray 
on theseus to help him to warray  
and shortly either he would lose his life  
or winnen emily unto his wife  
this is th  effect  and his intention plain  
now will i turn to arcita again  
that little wist how nighe was his care  
till that fortune had brought him in the snare  
the busy lark  the messenger of day  
saluteth in her song the morning gray  
and fiery phoebus riseth up so bright  
that all the orient laugheth at the sight  
and with his streames drieth in the greves 
the silver droppes  hanging on the leaves  
and arcite  that is in the court royal 
with theseus  his squier principal  
is ris n  and looketh on the merry day  
and for to do his observance to may  
remembering the point of his desire  
he on his courser  starting as the fire  
is ridden to the fieldes him to play  
out of the court  were it a mile or tway  
and to the grove  of which i have you told  
by a venture his way began to hold  
to make him a garland of the greves  
were it of woodbine  or of hawthorn leaves  
and loud he sang against the sun so sheen  
 o may  with all thy flowers and thy green  
right welcome be thou  faire freshe may  
i hope that i some green here getten may   
and from his courser  with a lusty heart  
into the grove full hastily he start  
and in a path he roamed up and down  
there as by aventure this palamon 
was in a bush  that no man might him see  
for sore afeard of his death was he  
nothing ne knew he that it was arcite  
god wot he would have trowed it full lite  
but sooth is said  gone since full many years  
the field hath eyen  and the wood hath ears  
it is full fair a man to bear him even  
for all day meeten men at unset steven  
full little wot arcite of his fellaw  
that was so nigh to hearken of his saw  
for in the bush he sitteth now full still  
when that arcite had roamed all his fill  
and sungen all the roundel lustily  
into a study he fell suddenly  
as do those lovers in their quainte gears  
now in the crop  and now down in the breres  
now up  now down  as bucket in a well  
right as the friday  soothly for to tell  
now shineth it  and now it raineth fast  
right so can geary venus overcast 
the heartes of her folk  right as her day 
is gearful  right so changeth she array  
seldom is friday all the weeke like  
when arcite had y sung  he gan to sike  
and sat him down withouten any more  
 alas   quoth he   the day that i was bore  
how longe  juno  through thy cruelty 
wilt thou warrayen thebes the city  
alas  y brought is to confusion 
the blood royal of cadm  and amphion  
of cadmus  which that was the firste man  
that thebes built  or first the town began  
and of the city first was crowned king  
of his lineage am i  and his offspring 
by very line  as of the stock royal  
and now i am so caitiff and so thrall  
that he that is my mortal enemy  
i serve him as his squier poorely  
and yet doth juno me well more shame  
for i dare not beknow mine owen name  
but there as i was wont to hight arcite  
now hight i philostrate  not worth a mite  
alas  thou fell mars  and alas  juno  
thus hath your ire our lineage all fordo 
save only me  and wretched palamon  
that theseus martyreth in prison  
and over all this  to slay me utterly  
love hath his fiery dart so brenningly 
y sticked through my true careful heart  
that shapen was my death erst than my shert  
ye slay me with your eyen  emily  
ye be the cause wherefore that i die  
of all the remnant of mine other care 
ne set i not the mountance of a tare  
so that i could do aught to your pleasance   
and with that word he fell down in a trance 
a longe time  and afterward upstart 
this palamon  that thought thorough his heart 
he felt a cold sword suddenly to glide  
for ire he quoke  no longer would he hide  
and when that he had heard arcite s tale  
as he were wood  with face dead and pale  
he start him up out of the bushes thick  
and said   false arcita  false traitor wick   
now art thou hent  that lov st my lady so  
for whom that i have all this pain and woe  
and art my blood  and to my counsel sworn  
as i full oft have told thee herebeforn  
and hast bejaped here duke theseus  
and falsely changed hast thy name thus  
i will be dead  or elles thou shalt die  
thou shalt not love my lady emily  
but i will love her only and no mo   
for i am palamon thy mortal foe  
and though i have no weapon in this place  
but out of prison am astart by grace  
i dreade not that either thou shalt die  
or else thou shalt not loven emily  
choose which thou wilt  for thou shalt not astart   
this arcite then  with full dispiteous heart  
when he him knew  and had his tale heard  
as fierce as lion pulled out a swerd  
and saide thus   by god that sitt th above  
n ere it that thou art sick  and wood for love  
and eke that thou no weap n hast in this place  
thou should st never out of this grove pace  
that thou ne shouldest dien of mine hand  
for i defy the surety and the band  
which that thou sayest i have made to thee  
what  very fool  think well that love is free  
and i will love her maugre all thy might  
but  for thou art a worthy gentle knight  
and wilnest to darraine her by bataille  
have here my troth  to morrow i will not fail  by combat 
without weeting of any other wight  
that here i will be founden as a knight  
and bringe harness right enough for thee  
and choose the best  and leave the worst for me  
and meat and drinke this night will i bring 
enough for thee  and clothes for thy bedding  
and if so be that thou my lady win  
and slay me in this wood that i am in  
thou may st well have thy lady as for me   
this palamon answer d   i grant it thee   
and thus they be departed till the morrow  
when each of them hath laid his faith to borrow  
o cupid  out of alle charity  
o regne that wilt no fellow have with thee  
full sooth is said  that love nor lordeship 
will not  his thanks  have any fellowship  
well finden that arcite and palamon  
arcite is ridd anon unto the town  
and on the morrow  ere it were daylight  
full privily two harness hath he dight  
both suffisant and meete to darraine 
the battle in the field betwixt them twain  
and on his horse  alone as he was born  
he carrieth all this harness him beforn  
and in the grove  at time and place y set  
this arcite and this palamon be met  
then change gan the colour of their face  
right as the hunter in the regne of thrace 
that standeth at a gappe with a spear 
when hunted is the lion or the bear  
and heareth him come rushing in the greves  
and breaking both the boughes and the leaves  
thinketh   here comes my mortal enemy  
withoute fail  he must be dead or i  
for either i must slay him at the gap  
or he must slay me  if that me mishap   
so fared they  in changing of their hue 
as far as either of them other knew  
there was no good day  and no saluting  other afar off 
but straight  withoute wordes rehearsing  
evereach of them holp to arm the other  
as friendly  as he were his owen brother  
and after that  with sharpe speares strong 
they foined each at other wonder long  
thou mightest weene  that this palamon 
in fighting were as a wood lion  
and as a cruel tiger was arcite  
as wilde boars gan they together smite  
that froth as white as foam  for ire wood  
up to the ancle fought they in their blood  
and in this wise i let them fighting dwell  
and forth i will of theseus you tell  
the destiny  minister general  
that executeth in the world o er all 
the purveyance  that god hath seen beforn  
so strong it is  that though the world had sworn 
the contrary of a thing by yea or nay  
yet some time it shall fallen on a day 
that falleth not eft in a thousand year  
for certainly our appetites here  
be it of war  or peace  or hate  or love  
all is this ruled by the sight above  
this mean i now by mighty theseus  
that for to hunten is so desirous   
and namely the greate hart in may   
that in his bed there dawneth him no day 
that he n is clad  and ready for to ride 
with hunt and horn  and houndes him beside  
for in his hunting hath he such delight  
that it is all his joy and appetite 
to be himself the greate harte s bane 
for after mars he serveth now diane  
clear was the day  as i have told ere this  
and theseus  with alle joy and bliss  
with his hippolyta  the faire queen  
and emily  y clothed all in green  
on hunting be they ridden royally  
and to the grove  that stood there faste by  
in which there was an hart  as men him told  
duke theseus the straighte way doth hold  
and to the laund he rideth him full right  
there was the hart y wont to have his flight  
and over a brook  and so forth on his way  
this duke will have a course at him or tway 
with houndes  such as him lust to command  
and when this duke was come to the laund  
under the sun he looked  and anon 
he was ware of arcite and palamon  
that foughte breme  as it were bulles two  
the brighte swordes wente to and fro 
so hideously  that with the leaste stroke 
it seemed that it woulde fell an oak  
but what they were  nothing yet he wote  
this duke his courser with his spurres smote  
and at a start he was betwixt them two  
and pulled out a sword and cried   ho  
no more  on pain of losing of your head  
by mighty mars  he shall anon be dead 
that smiteth any stroke  that i may see  
but tell to me what mister men ye be  
that be so hardy for to fighte here 
withoute judge or other officer  
as though it were in listes royally  
this palamon answered hastily  
and saide   sir  what needeth wordes mo   
we have the death deserved bothe two  
two woful wretches be we  and caitives  
that be accumbered of our own lives  
and as thou art a rightful lord and judge  
so give us neither mercy nor refuge  
and slay me first  for sainte charity  
but slay my fellow eke as well as me  
or slay him first  for  though thou know it lite  
this is thy mortal foe  this is arcite 
that from thy land is banisht on his head  
for which he hath deserved to be dead  
for this is he that came unto thy gate 
and saide  that he highte philostrate  
thus hath he japed thee full many year  
and thou hast made of him thy chief esquier  
and this is he  that loveth emily  
for since the day is come that i shall die 
i make pleinly my confession  
that i am thilke woful palamon  
that hath thy prison broken wickedly  
i am thy mortal foe  and it am i 
that so hot loveth emily the bright  
that i would die here present in her sight  
therefore i aske death and my jewise  
but slay my fellow eke in the same wise  
for both we have deserved to be slain   
this worthy duke answer d anon again  
and said   this is a short conclusion  
your own mouth  by your own confession 
hath damned you  and i will it record  
it needeth not to pain you with the cord  
ye shall be dead  by mighty mars the red  
the queen anon for very womanhead 
began to weep  and so did emily  
and all the ladies in the company  
great pity was it as it thought them all  
that ever such a chance should befall  
for gentle men they were  of great estate  
and nothing but for love was this debate 
they saw their bloody woundes wide and sore  
and cried all at once  both less and more  
 have mercy  lord  upon us women all   
and on their bare knees adown they fall 
and would have kissed his feet there as he stood  
till at the last aslaked was his mood 
for pity runneth soon in gentle heart  appeased 
and though at first for ire he quoke and start 
he hath consider d shortly in a clause 
the trespass of them both  and eke the cause  
and although that his ire their guilt accused 
yet in his reason he them both excused  
as thus  he thoughte well that every man 
will help himself in love if that he can  
and eke deliver himself out of prison  
of women  for they wepten ever in one  
and eke his hearte had compassion 
and in his gentle heart he thought anon  
and soft unto himself he saide   fie 
upon a lord that will have no mercy  
but be a lion both in word and deed  
to them that be in repentance and dread  
as well as to a proud dispiteous man 
that will maintaine what he first began  
that lord hath little of discretion  
that in such case can no division  
but weigheth pride and humbless after one   
and shortly  when his ire is thus agone  
he gan to look on them with eyen light  
and spake these same wordes all on height  
 the god of love  ah  benedicite  
how mighty and how great a lord is he  
against his might there gaine none obstacles  
he may be called a god for his miracles 
for he can maken at his owen guise 
of every heart  as that him list devise  
lo here this arcite  and this palamon  
that quietly were out of my prison  
and might have lived in thebes royally  
and weet i am their mortal enemy  
and that their death li th in my might also  
and yet hath love  maugre their eyen two  
y brought them hither bothe for to die  
now look ye  is not this an high folly  
who may not be a fool  if but he love  
behold  for godde s sake that sits above  
see how they bleed  be they not well array d  
thus hath their lord  the god of love  them paid 
their wages and their fees for their service  
and yet they weene for to be full wise  
that serve love  for aught that may befall  
but this is yet the beste game of all  
that she  for whom they have this jealousy  
can them therefor as muchel thank as me  
she wot no more of all this hote fare  
by god  than wot a cuckoo or an hare  
but all must be assayed hot or cold  
a man must be a fool  or young or old  
i wot it by myself full yore agone  
for in my time a servant was i one  
and therefore since i know of love s pain  
and wot how sore it can a man distrain  
as he that oft hath been caught in his last  
i you forgive wholly this trespass  
at request of the queen that kneeleth here  
and eke of emily  my sister dear  
and ye shall both anon unto me swear  
that never more ye shall my country dere 
nor make war upon me night nor day  
but be my friends in alle that ye may  
i you forgive this trespass every deal  
and they him sware his asking fair and well  
and him of lordship and of mercy pray d  
and he them granted grace  and thus he said  
 to speak of royal lineage and richess  
though that she were a queen or a princess  
each of you both is worthy doubteless 
to wedde when time is  but natheless 
i speak as for my sister emily  
for whom ye have this strife and jealousy  
ye wot yourselves  she may not wed the two 
at once  although ye fight for evermo  
but one of you  all be him loth or lief  
he must go pipe into an ivy leaf  
this is to say  she may not have you both  
all be ye never so jealous  nor so wroth  
and therefore i you put in this degree  
that each of you shall have his destiny 
as him is shape  and hearken in what wise 
lo hear your end of that i shall devise  
my will is this  for plain conclusion 
withouten any replication  
if that you liketh  take it for the best  
that evereach of you shall go where him lest  
freely without ransom or danger  
and this day fifty weekes  farre ne nerre  
evereach of you shall bring an hundred knights  
armed for listes up at alle rights 
all ready to darraine her by bataille  
and this behete i you withoute fail 
upon my troth  and as i am a knight  
that whether of you bothe that hath might  
that is to say  that whether he or thou 
may with his hundred  as i spake of now  
slay his contrary  or out of listes drive  
him shall i given emily to wive  
to whom that fortune gives so fair a grace  
the listes shall i make here in this place  
and god so wisly on my soule rue  
as i shall even judge be and true  
ye shall none other ende with me maken 
than one of you shalle be dead or taken  
and if you thinketh this is well y said  
say your advice  and hold yourselves apaid  
this is your end  and your conclusion   
who looketh lightly now but palamon  
who springeth up for joye but arcite  
who could it tell  or who could it indite  
the joye that is maked in the place 
when theseus hath done so fair a grace  
but down on knees went every manner wight  
and thanked him with all their heartes  might  
and namely these thebans ofte sithe  
and thus with good hope and with hearte blithe 
they take their leave  and homeward gan they ride 
to thebes ward  with his old walles wide  
i trow men woulde deem it negligence  
if i forgot to telle the dispence 
of theseus  that went so busily 
to maken up the listes royally  
that such a noble theatre as it was  
i dare well say  in all this world there n as  
the circuit a mile was about  
walled of stone  and ditched all without  
round was the shape  in manner of compass  
full of degrees  the height of sixty pas 
that when a man was set on one degree 
he letted not his fellow for to see  
eastward there stood a gate of marble white  
westward right such another opposite  
and  shortly to conclude  such a place 
was never on earth made in so little space  
for in the land there was no craftes man  
that geometry or arsmetrike can  
nor pourtrayor  nor carver of images  
that theseus ne gave him meat and wages 
the theatre to make and to devise  
and for to do his rite and sacrifice 
he eastward hath upon the gate above  
in worship of venus  goddess of love  
done make an altar and an oratory  
and westward  in the mind and in memory 
of mars  he maked hath right such another  
that coste largely of gold a fother  
and northward  in a turret on the wall  
of alabaster white and red coral 
an oratory riche for to see  
in worship of diane of chastity  
hath theseus done work in noble wise  
but yet had i forgotten to devise 
the noble carving  and the portraitures  
the shape  the countenance of the figures 
that weren in there oratories three  
first in the temple of venus may st thou see 
wrought on the wall  full piteous to behold  
the broken sleepes  and the sikes cold  
the sacred teares  and the waimentings  
the fiery strokes of the desirings  
that love s servants in this life endure  
the oathes  that their covenants assure  
pleasance and hope  desire  foolhardiness  
beauty and youth  and bawdry and richess  
charms and sorc ry  leasings and flattery  
dispence  business  and jealousy  
that wore of yellow goldes a garland  
and had a cuckoo sitting on her hand  
feasts  instruments  and caroles and dances  
lust and array  and all the circumstances 
of love  which i reckon d and reckon shall 
in order  were painted on the wall  
and more than i can make of mention  
for soothly all the mount of citheron  
where venus hath her principal dwelling  
was showed on the wall in pourtraying  
with all the garden  and the lustiness  
nor was forgot the porter idleness  
nor narcissus the fair of yore agone  
nor yet the folly of king solomon  
nor yet the greate strength of hercules  
th  enchantments of medea and circes  
nor of turnus the hardy fierce courage  
the rich croesus caitif in servage  
thus may ye see  that wisdom nor richess  
beauty  nor sleight  nor strength  nor hardiness 
ne may with venus holde champartie  
for as her liste the world may she gie  
lo  all these folk so caught were in her las 
till they for woe full often said  alas  
suffice these ensamples one or two  
although i could reckon a thousand mo   
the statue of venus  glorious to see 
was naked floating in the large sea  
and from the navel down all cover d was 
with waves green  and bright as any glass  
a citole in her right hand hadde she  
and on her head  full seemly for to see  
a rose garland fresh  and well smelling  
above her head her doves flickering 
before her stood her sone cupido  
upon his shoulders winges had he two  
and blind he was  as it is often seen  
a bow he bare  and arrows bright and keen  
why should i not as well eke tell you all 
the portraiture  that was upon the wall 
within the temple of mighty mars the red  
all painted was the wall in length and brede 
like to the estres of the grisly place 
that hight the great temple of mars in thrace  
in thilke cold and frosty region  
there as mars hath his sovereign mansion  
in which there dwelled neither man nor beast  
with knotty gnarry barren trees old 
of stubbes sharp and hideous to behold  
in which there ran a rumble and a sough  
as though a storm should bursten every bough  
and downward from an hill under a bent 
there stood the temple of mars armipotent  
wrought all of burnish d steel  of which th  entry 
was long and strait  and ghastly for to see  
and thereout came a rage and such a vise  
that it made all the gates for to rise  
the northern light in at the doore shone  
for window on the walle was there none 
through which men mighten any light discern  
the doors were all of adamant etern  
y clenched overthwart and ende long 
with iron tough  and  for to make it strong  
every pillar the temple to sustain 
was tunne great  of iron bright and sheen  
there saw i first the dark imagining 
of felony  and all the compassing  
the cruel ire  as red as any glede  
the picke purse  and eke the pale dread  
the smiler with the knife under the cloak  
the shepen burning with the blacke smoke 
the treason of the murd ring in the bed  
the open war  with woundes all be bled  
conteke with bloody knife  and sharp menace  
all full of chirking was that sorry place  
the slayer of himself eke saw i there  
his hearte blood had bathed all his hair  
the nail y driven in the shode at night  
the colde death  with mouth gaping upright  
amiddes of the temple sat mischance  
with discomfort and sorry countenance  
eke saw i woodness laughing in his rage  
armed complaint  outhees  and fierce outrage  
the carrain in the bush  with throat y corve  
a thousand slain  and not of qualm y storve  
the tyrant  with the prey by force y reft  
the town destroy d  that there was nothing left  
yet saw i brent the shippes hoppesteres  
the hunter strangled with the wilde bears  
the sow freting the child right in the cradle  
the cook scalded  for all his longe ladle  
nor was forgot  by th infortune of mart 
the carter overridden with his cart  of war 
under the wheel full low he lay adown  
there were also of mars  division  
the armourer  the bowyer  and the smith  
that forgeth sharp swordes on his stith  
and all above depainted in a tower 
saw i conquest  sitting in great honour  
with thilke sharpe sword over his head 
hanging by a subtle y twined thread  
painted the slaughter was of julius  
of cruel nero  and antonius  
although at that time they were yet unborn  
yet was their death depainted there beforn  
by menacing of mars  right by figure  
so was it showed in that portraiture  
as is depainted in the stars above  
who shall be slain  or elles dead for love  
sufficeth one ensample in stories old  
i may not reckon them all  though i wo ld  
the statue of mars upon a carte stood 
armed  and looked grim as he were wood  
and over his head there shone two figures 
of starres  that be cleped in scriptures  
that one puella  that other rubeus  
this god of armes was arrayed thus  
a wolf there stood before him at his feet 
with eyen red  and of a man he eat  
with subtle pencil painted was this story  
in redouting of mars and of his glory  
now to the temple of dian the chaste 
as shortly as i can i will me haste  
to telle you all the descriptioun  
depainted be the walles up and down 
of hunting and of shamefast chastity  
there saw i how woful calistope  
when that dian aggrieved was with her  
was turned from a woman to a bear  
and after was she made the lodestar  
thus was it painted  i can say no far  
her son is eke a star as men may see  
there saw i dane turn d into a tree  
i meane not the goddess diane  
but peneus  daughter  which that hight dane  
there saw i actaeon an hart y maked  
for vengeance that he saw dian all naked  
i saw how that his houndes have him caught  
and freten him  for that they knew him not  
yet painted was  a little farthermore 
how atalanta hunted the wild boar  
and meleager  and many other mo   
for which diana wrought them care and woe  
there saw i many another wondrous story  
the which me list not drawen to memory  
this goddess on an hart full high was set  
with smalle houndes all about her feet  
and underneath her feet she had a moon  
waxing it was  and shoulde wane soon  
in gaudy green her statue clothed was  
with bow in hand  and arrows in a case  
her eyen caste she full low adown  
where pluto hath his darke regioun  
a woman travailing was her beforn  
but  for her child so longe was unborn  
full piteously lucina gan she call  
and saide   help  for thou may st best of all   
well could he painte lifelike that it wrought  
with many a florin he the hues had bought  
now be these listes made  and theseus  
that at his greate cost arrayed thus 
the temples  and the theatre every deal  
when it was done  him liked wonder well  
but stint i will of theseus a lite  
and speak of palamon and of arcite  
the day approacheth of their returning  
that evereach an hundred knights should bring  
the battle to darraine as i you told  
and to athens  their covenant to hold  
hath ev reach of them brought an hundred knights  
well armed for the war at alle rights  
and sickerly there trowed many a man  
that never  sithen that the world began  
for to speaken of knighthood of their hand  
as far as god hath maked sea and land  
was  of so few  so noble a company  
for every wight that loved chivalry  
and would  his thankes  have a passant name  
had prayed  that he might be of that game  efforts  have a 
and well was him  that thereto chosen was  
for if there fell to morrow such a case  
ye knowe well  that every lusty knight  
that loveth par amour  and hath his might 
were it in engleland  or elleswhere  
they would  their thankes  willen to be there  
t  fight for a lady  benedicite  
it were a lusty sighte for to see  
and right so fared they with palamon  
with him there wente knightes many one  
some will be armed in an habergeon  
and in a breast plate  and in a gipon  
and some will have a pair of plates large  
and some will have a prusse shield  or targe  
some will be armed on their legges weel  
some have an axe  and some a mace of steel  
there is no newe guise  but it was old  
armed they weren  as i have you told  
evereach after his opinion  
there may st thou see coming with palamon 
licurgus himself  the great king of thrace  
black was his beard  and manly was his face  
the circles of his eyen in his head 
they glowed betwixte yellow and red  
and like a griffin looked he about  
with kemped haires on his browes stout  
his limbs were great  his brawns were hard and strong  
his shoulders broad  his armes round and long  
and as the guise was in his country  
full high upon a car of gold stood he  
with foure white bulles in the trace  
instead of coat armour on his harness  
with yellow nails  and bright as any gold  
he had a beare s skin  coal black for old  
his long hair was y kempt behind his back  
as any raven s feather it shone for black  
a wreath of gold arm great  of huge weight  
upon his head sate  full of stones bright  
of fine rubies and clear diamants  
about his car there wente white alauns  
twenty and more  as great as any steer  
to hunt the lion or the wilde bear  
and follow d him  with muzzle fast y bound  
collars of gold  and torettes filed round  
an hundred lordes had he in his rout 
armed full well  with heartes stern and stout  
with arcita  in stories as men find  
the great emetrius the king of ind  
upon a steede bay trapped in steel  
cover d with cloth of gold diapred well  
came riding like the god of armes  mars  
his coat armour was of a cloth of tars  
couched with pearls white and round and great 
his saddle was of burnish d gold new beat  
a mantelet on his shoulders hanging  
bretful of rubies red  as fire sparkling  
his crispe hair like ringes was y run  
and that was yellow  glittering as the sun  
his nose was high  his eyen bright citrine  
his lips were round  his colour was sanguine  
a fewe fracknes in his face y sprent  
betwixte yellow and black somedeal y ment 
and as a lion he his looking cast 
of five and twenty year his age i cast 
his beard was well begunnen for to spring  
his voice was as a trumpet thundering  
upon his head he wore of laurel green 
a garland fresh and lusty to be seen  
upon his hand he bare  for his delight  
an eagle tame  as any lily white  
an hundred lordes had he with him there  
all armed  save their heads  in all their gear  
full richely in alle manner things  
for trust ye well  that earles  dukes  and kings 
were gather d in this noble company  
for love  and for increase of chivalry  
about this king there ran on every part 
full many a tame lion and leopart  
and in this wise these lordes all and some 
be on the sunday to the city come 
aboute prime  and in the town alight  
this theseus  this duke  this worthy knight 
when he had brought them into his city  
and inned them  ev reach at his degree  
he feasteth them  and doth so great labour 
to easen them  and do them all honour  
that yet men weene that no mannes wit 
of none estate could amenden it  
the minstrelsy  the service at the feast  
the greate giftes to the most and least  
the rich array of theseus  palace  
nor who sate first or last upon the dais  
what ladies fairest be  or best dancing 
or which of them can carol best or sing  
or who most feelingly speaketh of love  
what hawkes sitten on the perch above  
what houndes liggen on the floor adown  
of all this now make i no mentioun 
but of th effect  that thinketh me the best 
now comes the point  and hearken if you lest  
the sunday night  ere day began to spring  
when palamon the larke hearde sing  
although it were not day by houres two  
yet sang the lark  and palamon right tho 
with holy heart  and with an high courage  
arose  to wenden on his pilgrimage 
unto the blissful cithera benign  
i meane venus  honourable and digne  
and in her hour he walketh forth a pace 
unto the listes  where her temple was  
and down he kneeleth  and with humble cheer 
and hearte sore  he said as ye shall hear  
 fairest of fair  o lady mine venus  
daughter to jove  and spouse of vulcanus  
thou gladder of the mount of citheron  
for thilke love thou haddest to adon 
have pity on my bitter teares smart  
and take mine humble prayer to thine heart  
alas  i have no language to tell 
th effecte  nor the torment of mine hell  
mine hearte may mine harmes not betray  
i am so confused  that i cannot say  
but mercy  lady bright  that knowest well 
my thought  and seest what harm that i feel  
consider all this  and rue upon my sore  
as wisly as i shall for evermore 
enforce my might  thy true servant to be  
and holde war alway with chastity  
that make i mine avow  so ye me help  
i keepe not of armes for to yelp  
nor ask i not to morrow to have victory  
nor renown in this case  nor vaine glory 
of prize of armes  blowing up and down  
but i would have fully possessioun 
of emily  and die in her service  
find thou the manner how  and in what wise  
i recke not but it may better be 
to have vict ry of them  or they of me  
so that i have my lady in mine arms  
for though so be that mars is god of arms  
your virtue is so great in heaven above  
that  if you list  i shall well have my love  
thy temple will i worship evermo   
and on thine altar  where i ride or go  
i will do sacrifice  and fires bete  
and if ye will not so  my lady sweet  
then pray i you  to morrow with a spear 
that arcita me through the hearte bear 
then reck i not  when i have lost my life  
though that arcita win her to his wife  
this is th  effect and end of my prayere    
give me my love  thou blissful lady dear   
when th  orison was done of palamon  
his sacrifice he did  and that anon  
full piteously  with alle circumstances  
all tell i not as now his observances  
but at the last the statue of venus shook  
and made a signe  whereby that he took 
that his prayer accepted was that day  
for though the signe shewed a delay  
yet wist he well that granted was his boon  
and with glad heart he went him home full soon  
the third hour unequal that palamon 
began to venus  temple for to gon  
up rose the sun  and up rose emily  
and to the temple of dian gan hie  
her maidens  that she thither with her lad  
th  incense  the clothes  and the remnant all 
that to the sacrifice belonge shall  
the hornes full of mead  as was the guise  
there lacked nought to do her sacrifice  
smoking the temple full of clothes fair  
this emily with hearte debonnair 
her body wash d with water of a well  
but how she did her rite i dare not tell  
but it be any thing in general  
and yet it were a game to hearen all 
to him that meaneth well it were no charge  
but it is good a man to be at large  
her bright hair combed was  untressed all  
a coronet of green oak cerriall 
upon her head was set full fair and meet  
two fires on the altar gan she bete  
and did her thinges  as men may behold 
in stace of thebes  and these bookes old  
when kindled was the fire  with piteous cheer 
unto dian she spake as ye may hear  
 o chaste goddess of the woodes green  
to whom both heav n and earth and sea is seen  
queen of the realm of pluto dark and low  
goddess of maidens  that mine heart hast know 
full many a year  and wost what i desire  
to keep me from the vengeance of thine ire  
that actaeon aboughte cruelly  
chaste goddess  well wottest thou that i 
desire to be a maiden all my life  
nor never will i be no love nor wife  
i am  thou wost  yet of thy company  
a maid  and love hunting and venery  
and for to walken in the woodes wild  
and not to be a wife  and be with child  
nought will i know the company of man  
now help me  lady  since ye may and can  
for those three formes that thou hast in thee  
and palamon  that hath such love to me  
and eke arcite  that loveth me so sore  
this grace i pray thee withoute more  
as sende love and peace betwixt them two  
and from me turn away their heartes so  
that all their hote love  and their desire  
and all their busy torment  and their fire  
be queint  or turn d into another place  
and if so be thou wilt do me no grace  
or if my destiny be shapen so 
that i shall needes have one of them two  
so send me him that most desireth me  
behold  goddess of cleane chastity  
the bitter tears that on my cheekes fall  
since thou art maid  and keeper of us all  
my maidenhead thou keep and well conserve  
and  while i live  a maid i will thee serve  
the fires burn upon the altar clear  
while emily was thus in her prayere  
but suddenly she saw a sighte quaint  
for right anon one of the fire s 
and quick d again  and after that anon 
that other fire was queint  and all agone  
and as it queint  it made a whisteling  
as doth a brande wet in its burning  
and at the brandes end outran anon 
as it were bloody droppes many one  
for which so sore aghast was emily  
that she was well nigh mad  and gan to cry  
for she ne wiste what it signified  
but onely for feare thus she cried  
and wept  that it was pity for to hear  
and therewithal diana gan appear 
with bow in hand  right as an hunteress  
and saide   daughter  stint thine heaviness  
among the goddes high it is affirm d  
and by eternal word writ and confirm d  
thou shalt be wedded unto one of tho 
that have for thee so muche care and woe  
but unto which of them i may not tell  
farewell  for here i may no longer dwell  
the fires which that on mine altar brenn  
shall thee declaren  ere that thou go henne  
thine aventure of love  as in this case   
and with that word  the arrows in the case 
of the goddess did clatter fast and ring  
and forth she went  and made a vanishing  
for which this emily astonied was  
and saide   what amounteth this  alas  
i put me under thy protection  
diane  and in thy disposition   
and home she went anon the nexte way  
this is th  effect  there is no more to say  
the nexte hour of mars following this 
arcite to the temple walked is 
of fierce mars  to do his sacrifice 
with all the rites of his pagan guise  
with piteous heart and high devotion 
right thus to mars he said his orison 
 o stronge god  that in the regnes old 
of thrace honoured art  and lord y hold 
and hast in every regne  and every land 
of armes all the bridle in thine hand  
and them fortunest as thee list devise  
accept of me my piteous sacrifice  
if so be that my youthe may deserve  
and that my might be worthy for to serve 
thy godhead  that i may be one of thine  
then pray i thee to rue upon my pine  
for thilke pain  and thilke hote fire 
in which thou whilom burned st for desire 
whenne that thou usedest the beauty 
of faire young venus  fresh and free  
and haddest her in armes at thy will  
and though thee ones on a time misfill  
when vulcanus had caught thee in his las  
and found thee ligging by his wife  alas  
for thilke sorrow that was in thine heart  
have ruth as well upon my paine s smart  
i am young and unconning  as thou know st  
and  as i trow  with love offended most 
that e er was any living creature  
for she  that doth me all this woe endure  
ne recketh ne er whether i sink or fleet 
and well i wot  ere she me mercy hete  
i must with strengthe win her in the place  
and well i wot  withoute help or grace 
of thee  ne may my strengthe not avail  
then help me  lord  to morr w in my bataille  
for thilke fire that whilom burned thee  
as well as this fire that now burneth me  
and do that i to morr w may have victory  
mine be the travail  all thine be the glory  
thy sovereign temple will i most honour 
of any place  and alway most labour 
in thy pleasance and in thy craftes strong  
and in thy temple i will my banner hong  
and all the armes of my company  
and evermore  until that day i die  
eternal fire i will before thee find 
and eke to this my vow i will me bind  
my beard  my hair that hangeth long adown  
that never yet hath felt offension 
of razor nor of shears  i will thee give  
and be thy true servant while i live  
now  lord  have ruth upon my sorrows sore  
give me the victory  i ask no more   
the prayer stint of arcita the strong  
the ringes on the temple door that hong  
and eke the doores  clattered full fast  
of which arcita somewhat was aghast  
the fires burn d upon the altar bright  
that it gan all the temple for to light  
a sweete smell anon the ground up gaf  
and arcita anon his hand up haf  
and more incense into the fire he cast  
with other rites more and at the last 
the statue of mars began his hauberk ring  
and with that sound he heard a murmuring 
full low and dim  that saide thus   victory   
for which he gave to mars honour and glory  
and thus with joy  and hope well to fare  
arcite anon unto his inn doth fare  
as fain as fowl is of the brighte sun  
and right anon such strife there is begun 
for thilke granting  in the heav n above  
betwixte venus the goddess of love  
and mars the sterne god armipotent  
that jupiter was busy it to stent  
till that the pale saturnus the cold  
that knew so many of adventures old  
found in his old experience such an art  
that he full soon hath pleased every part  
as sooth is said  eld hath great advantage  
in eld is bothe wisdom and usage  
men may the old out run  but not out rede  
saturn anon  to stint the strife and drede  
albeit that it is against his kind  
of all this strife gan a remedy find  
 my deare daughter venus   quoth saturn  
 my course  that hath so wide for to turn  
hath more power than wot any man  
mine is the drowning in the sea so wan  
mine is the prison in the darke cote  
mine the strangling and hanging by the throat  
the murmur  and the churlish rebelling  
the groyning  and the privy poisoning  
i do vengeance and plein correction  
i dwell in the sign of the lion  
mine is the ruin of the highe halls  
the falling of the towers and the walls 
upon the miner or the carpenter  
i slew samson in shaking the pillar  
mine also be the maladies cold  
the darke treasons  and the castes old  
my looking is the father of pestilence  
now weep no more  i shall do diligence 
that palamon  that is thine owen knight  
shall have his lady  as thou hast him hight  
though mars shall help his knight  yet natheless 
betwixte you there must sometime be peace  
all be ye not of one complexion  
that each day causeth such division  
i am thine ayel  ready at thy will  
weep now no more  i shall thy lust fulfil   
now will i stenten of the gods above  
of mars  and of venus  goddess of love  
and telle you as plainly as i can 
the great effect  for which that i began  
great was the feast in athens thilke day  
and eke the lusty season of that may 
made every wight to be in such pleasance  
that all that monday jousten they and dance  
and spenden it in venus  high service  
but by the cause that they shoulde rise 
early a morrow for to see that fight  
unto their reste wente they at night  
and on the morrow  when the day gan spring  
of horse and harness noise and clattering 
there was in the hostelries all about  
and to the palace rode there many a rout 
of lordes  upon steedes and palfreys  
there mayst thou see devising of harness 
so uncouth and so rich  and wrought so weel 
of goldsmithry  of brouding  and of steel  
the shieldes bright  the testers  and trappures 
gold hewen helmets  hauberks  coat armures  
lordes in parements on their coursers  
knightes of retinue  and eke squiers  
nailing the spears  and helmes buckeling  
gniding of shieldes  with lainers lacing  
there as need is  they were nothing idle  
the foamy steeds upon the golden bridle 
gnawing  and fast the armourers also 
with file and hammer pricking to and fro  
yeomen on foot  and knaves many one 
with shorte staves  thick as they may gon  
pipes  trumpets  nakeres  and clariouns  
that in the battle blowe bloody souns  
the palace full of people up and down  
there three  there ten  holding their questioun  
divining of these theban knightes two  
some saiden thus  some said it shall he so  
some helden with him with the blacke beard  
some with the bald  some with the thick hair d  
some said he looked grim  and woulde fight  
he had a sparth of twenty pound of weight  
thus was the halle full of divining 
long after that the sunne gan up spring  
the great theseus that of his sleep is waked 
with minstrelsy  and noise that was maked  
held yet the chamber of his palace rich  
till that the theban knightes both y lich 
honoured were  and to the palace fet  
duke theseus is at a window set  
array d right as he were a god in throne  
the people presseth thitherward full soon 
him for to see  and do him reverence  
and eke to hearken his hest and his sentence  
an herald on a scaffold made an o  
till the noise of the people was y do  
and when he saw the people of noise all still  
thus shewed he the mighty duke s will  
 the lord hath of his high discretion 
considered that it were destruction 
to gentle blood  to fighten in the guise 
of mortal battle now in this emprise  
wherefore to shape that they shall not die  
he will his firste purpose modify  
no man therefore  on pain of loss of life  
no manner shot  nor poleaxe  nor short knife 
into the lists shall send  or thither bring  
nor short sword for to stick with point biting 
no man shall draw  nor bear it by his side  
and no man shall unto his fellow ride 
but one course  with a sharp y grounden spear  
foin if him list on foot  himself to wear  
and he that is at mischief shall be take  fence on foot to defend 
and not slain  but be brought unto the stake  himself  and he that 
that shall be ordained on either side  is in peril shall be taken 
thither he shall by force  and there abide  
and if so fall the chiefetain be take 
on either side  or elles slay his make  
no longer then the tourneying shall last  
god speede you  go forth and lay on fast  
with long sword and with mace fight your fill  
go now your way  this is the lordes will  
the voice of the people touched the heaven  
so loude cried they with merry steven  
god save such a lord that is so good  
he willeth no destruction of blood  
up go the trumpets and the melody  
and to the listes rode the company 
by ordinance  throughout the city large  
hanged with cloth of gold  and not with sarge  
full like a lord this noble duke gan ride  
and these two thebans upon either side  
and after rode the queen and emily  
and after them another company 
of one and other  after their degree  
and thus they passed thorough that city 
and to the listes came they by time  
it was not of the day yet fully prime  
when set was theseus full rich and high  
hippolyta the queen and emily  
and other ladies in their degrees about  
unto the seates presseth all the rout  
and westward  through the gates under mart  
arcite  and eke the hundred of his part  
with banner red  is enter d right anon  
and in the selve moment palamon 
is  under venus  eastward in the place  
with banner white  and hardy cheer and face 
in all the world  to seeken up and down 
so even without variatioun 
there were such companies never tway  
for there was none so wise that coulde say 
that any had of other avantage 
of worthiness  nor of estate  nor age  
so even were they chosen for to guess  
and in two ranges faire they them dress  
when that their names read were every one  in two rows 
that in their number guile were there none  
then were the gates shut  and cried was loud  
 do now your devoir  younge knights proud 
the heralds left their pricking up and down 
now ring the trumpet loud and clarioun  
there is no more to say  but east and west 
in go the speares sadly in the rest  
in go the sharpe spurs into the side  
there see me who can joust  and who can ride  
there shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick  
he feeleth through the hearte spoon the prick  
up spring the speares twenty foot on height  
out go the swordes as the silver bright  
the helmes they to hewen  and to shred  
out burst the blood  with sterne streames red  
with mighty maces the bones they to brest  
he through the thickest of the throng gan threst  
there stumble steedes strong  and down go all  
he rolleth under foot as doth a ball  
he foineth on his foe with a trunchoun  
and he him hurtleth with his horse adown  
he through the body hurt is  and sith take  
maugre his head  and brought unto the stake  
as forword was  right there he must abide  
another led is on that other side  
and sometime doth them theseus to rest  
them to refresh  and drinken if them lest  
full oft a day have thilke thebans two 
together met and wrought each other woe  
unhorsed hath each other of them tway 
there is no tiger in the vale of galaphay  
when that her whelp is stole  when it is lite 
so cruel on the hunter  as arcite 
for jealous heart upon this palamon  
nor in belmarie there is no fell lion  
that hunted is  or for his hunger wood 
or for his prey desireth so the blood  
as palamon to slay his foe arcite  
the jealous strokes upon their helmets bite  
out runneth blood on both their sides red  
sometime an end there is of every deed 
for ere the sun unto the reste went  
the stronge king emetrius gan hent 
this palamon  as he fought with arcite  
and made his sword deep in his flesh to bite  
and by the force of twenty is he take  
unyielding  and is drawn unto the stake  
and in the rescue of this palamon 
the stronge king licurgus is borne down  
and king emetrius  for all his strength 
is borne out of his saddle a sword s length  
so hit him palamon ere he were take  
but all for nought  he was brought to the stake  
his hardy hearte might him helpe naught  
he must abide when that he was caught  
by force  and eke by composition  
who sorroweth now but woful palamon 
that must no more go again to fight  
and when that theseus had seen that sight 
unto the folk that foughte thus each one  
he cried  ho  no more  for it is done  
i will be true judge  and not party  
arcite of thebes shall have emily  
that by his fortune hath her fairly won   
anon there is a noise of people gone  
for joy of this  so loud and high withal  
it seemed that the listes shoulde fall  
what can now faire venus do above  
what saith she now  what doth this queen of love  
but weepeth so  for wanting of her will  
till that her teares in the listes fill 
she said   i am ashamed doubteless   
saturnus saide   daughter  hold thy peace  
mars hath his will  his knight hath all his boon  
and by mine head thou shalt be eased soon   
 the trumpeters with the loud minstrelsy  
the heralds  that full loude yell and cry  
be in their joy for weal of dan arcite  
but hearken me  and stinte noise a lite  
what a miracle there befell anon 
this fierce arcite hath off his helm y done  
and on a courser for to shew his face 
he pricketh endelong the large place  
looking upward upon this emily  
and she again him cast a friendly eye 
for women  as to speaken in commune  
they follow all the favour of fortune  
and was all his in cheer  as his in heart  
out of the ground a fire infernal start  
from pluto sent  at request of saturn 
for which his horse for fear began to turn  
and leap aside  and founder as he leap 
and ere that arcite may take any keep  
he pight him on the pummel of his head  
that in the place he lay as he were dead  
his breast to bursten with his saddle bow  
as black he lay as any coal or crow  
so was the blood y run into his face  
anon he was y borne out of the place 
with hearte sore  to theseus  palace  
then was he carven out of his harness  
and in a bed y brought full fair and blive 
for he was yet in mem ry and alive  
and always crying after emily  
duke theseus  with all his company  
is come home to athens his city  
with alle bliss and great solemnity  
albeit that this aventure was fall  
he woulde not discomforte them all 
then said eke  that arcite should not die  
he should be healed of his malady  
and of another thing they were as fain  
that of them alle was there no one slain  
all were they sorely hurt  and namely one  
that with a spear was thirled his breast bone  
to other woundes  and to broken arms  
some hadden salves  and some hadden charms  
and pharmacies of herbs  and eke save 
they dranken  for they would their lives have  
for which this noble duke  as he well can  
comforteth and honoureth every man  
and made revel all the longe night  
unto the strange lordes  as was right  
nor there was holden no discomforting  
but as at jousts or at a tourneying  
for soothly there was no discomfiture  
for falling is not but an aventure  
nor to be led by force unto a stake 
unyielding  and with twenty knights y take 
one person all alone  withouten mo   
and harried forth by armes  foot  and toe  
and eke his steede driven forth with staves  
with footmen  bothe yeomen and eke knaves  
it was aretted him no villainy  
there may no man clepen it cowardy  
for which anon duke theseus let cry    
to stenten alle rancour and envy    
the gree as well on one side as the other  
and either side alike as other s brother  
and gave them giftes after their degree  
and held a feaste fully dayes three  
and conveyed the kinges worthily 
out of his town a journee largely 
and home went every man the righte way  
there was no more but  farewell  have good day   
of this bataille i will no more indite 
but speak of palamon and of arcite  
swelleth the breast of arcite and the sore 
increaseth at his hearte more and more  
the clotted blood  for any leache craft 
corrupteth and is in his bouk y laft 
that neither veine blood nor ventousing  
nor drink of herbes may be his helping  
the virtue expulsive or animal  
from thilke virtue called natural  
nor may the venom voide  nor expel 
the pipes of his lungs began to swell 
and every lacert in his breast adown 
is shent with venom and corruption  
him gaineth neither  for to get his life  
vomit upward  nor downward laxative  
all is to bursten thilke region  
nature hath now no domination  
and certainly where nature will not wirch  
farewell physic  go bear the man to chirch  
this all and some is  arcite must die  
for which he sendeth after emily  
and palamon  that was his cousin dear  
then said he thus  as ye shall after hear  
 nought may the woful spirit in mine heart 
declare one point of all my sorrows  smart 
to you  my lady  that i love the most  
but i bequeath the service of my ghost 
to you aboven every creature  
since that my life ne may no longer dure  
alas the woe  alas  the paines strong 
that i for you have suffered and so long  
alas the death  alas  mine emily  
alas departing of our company  
alas  mine hearte s queen  alas  my wife  
mine hearte s lady  ender of my life  
what is this world  what aske men to have  
now with his love  now in his colde grave 
al one  withouten any company  
farewell  my sweet  farewell  mine emily  
and softly take me in your armes tway  
for love of god  and hearken what i say  
i have here with my cousin palamon 
had strife and rancour many a day agone  
for love of you  and for my jealousy  
and jupiter so wis my soule gie  
to speaken of a servant properly  
with alle circumstances truely  
that is to say  truth  honour  and knighthead  
wisdom  humbless  estate  and high kindred  
freedom  and all that longeth to that art  
so jupiter have of my soul part  
as in this world right now i know not one  
so worthy to be lov d as palamon  
that serveth you  and will do all his life  
and if that you shall ever be a wife  
forget not palamon  the gentle man   
and with that word his speech to fail began  
for from his feet up to his breast was come 
the cold of death  that had him overnome  
and yet moreover in his armes two 
the vital strength is lost  and all ago  
only the intellect  withoute more  
that dwelled in his hearte sick and sore  
gan faile  when the hearte felte death  
dusked his eyen two  and fail d his breath  
but on his lady yet he cast his eye  
his laste word was   mercy  emily   
his spirit changed house  and wente there  
as i came never i cannot telle where  
therefore i stent  i am no divinister  
of soules find i nought in this register  
ne me list not th  opinions to tell 
of them  though that they writen where they dwell  
arcite is cold  there mars his soule gie 
now will i speake forth of emily  
shriek d emily  and howled palamon  
and theseus his sister took anon 
swooning  and bare her from the corpse away  
what helpeth it to tarry forth the day  
to telle how she wept both eve and morrow  
for in such cases women have such sorrow  
when that their husbands be from them y go  
that for the more part they sorrow so  
or elles fall into such malady  
that at the laste certainly they die  
infinite be the sorrows and the tears 
of olde folk  and folk of tender years  
in all the town  for death of this theban  
for him there weepeth bothe child and man  
so great a weeping was there none certain  
when hector was y brought  all fresh y slain  
to troy  alas  the pity that was there  
scratching of cheeks  and rending eke of hair  
 why wouldest thou be dead   these women cry  
 and haddest gold enough  and emily   
no manner man might gladden theseus  
saving his olde father egeus  
that knew this worlde s transmutatioun  
as he had seen it changen up and down  
joy after woe  and woe after gladness  
and shewed him example and likeness  
 right as there died never man   quoth he  
 that he ne liv d in earth in some degree  
right so there lived never man   he said  
 in all this world  that sometime be not died  
this world is but a throughfare full of woe  
and we be pilgrims  passing to and fro  
death is an end of every worldly sore   
and over all this said he yet much more 
to this effect  full wisely to exhort 
the people  that they should them recomfort  
duke theseus  with all his busy cure  
casteth about  where that the sepulture 
of good arcite may best y maked be  
and eke most honourable in his degree  
and at the last he took conclusion  
that there as first arcite and palamon 
hadde for love the battle them between  
that in that selve grove  sweet and green  
there as he had his amorous desires  
his complaint  and for love his hote fires  
he woulde make a fire  in which th  office 
of funeral he might all accomplice  
and let anon command to hack and hew 
the oakes old  and lay them on a rew 
in culpons  well arrayed for to brenne  
his officers with swifte feet they renne 
and ride anon at his commandement  
and after this  duke theseus hath sent 
after a bier  and it all oversprad 
with cloth of gold  the richest that he had  
and of the same suit he clad arcite  
upon his handes were his gloves white  
eke on his head a crown of laurel green  
and in his hand a sword full bright and keen  
he laid him bare the visage on the bier  
therewith he wept  that pity was to hear  
and  for the people shoulde see him all  
when it was day he brought them to the hall  
that roareth of the crying and the soun   
then came this woful theban  palamon  
with sluttery beard  and ruggy ashy hairs  
in clothes black  y dropped all with tears  
and passing over weeping emily 
the ruefullest of all the company  
and inasmuch as the service should be 
the more noble and rich in its degree  
duke theseus let forth three steedes bring  
that trapped were in steel all glittering  
and covered with the arms of dan arcite  
upon these steedes  that were great and white  
there satte folk  of whom one bare his shield  
another his spear in his handes held  
the thirde bare with him his bow turkeis  
of brent gold was the case and the harness  
and ride forth a pace with sorrowful cheer 
toward the grove  as ye shall after hear  
the noblest of the greekes that there were 
upon their shoulders carried the bier  
with slacke pace  and eyen red and wet  
throughout the city  by the master street  
that spread was all with black  and wondrous high 
right of the same is all the street y wrie  
upon the right hand went old egeus  
and on the other side duke theseus  
with vessels in their hand of gold full fine  
all full of honey  milk  and blood  and wine  
eke palamon  with a great company  
and after that came woful emily  
with fire in hand  as was that time the guise  
to do th  office of funeral service  
high labour  and full great appareling 
was at the service  and the pyre making  
that with its greene top the heaven raught  
and twenty fathom broad its armes straught  
this is to say  the boughes were so broad  
of straw first there was laid many a load  
but how the pyre was maked up on height  
and eke the names how the trees hight  
as oak  fir  birch  asp  alder  holm  poplere  
willow  elm  plane  ash  box  chestnut  lind  laurere  
maple  thorn  beech  hazel  yew  whipul tree  
how they were fell d  shall not be told for me  
nor how the goddes rannen up and down 
disinherited of their habitatioun  
in which they wonned had in rest and peace  
nymphes  faunes  and hamadryades  
nor how the beastes and the birdes all 
fledden for feare  when the wood gan fall  
nor how the ground aghast was of the light  
that was not wont to see the sunne bright  
nor how the fire was couched first with stre  
and then with dry stickes cloven in three  
and then with greene wood and spicery  
and then with cloth of gold and with pierrie  
and garlands hanging with full many a flower  
the myrrh  the incense with so sweet odour  
nor how arcita lay among all this  
nor what richess about his body is  
nor how that emily  as was the guise  
put in the fire of funeral service  
nor how she swooned when she made the fire  
nor what she spake  nor what was her desire  
nor what jewels men in the fire then cast 
when that the fire was great and burned fast  
nor how some cast their shield  and some their spear  
and of their vestiments  which that they wear  
and cuppes full of wine  and milk  and blood  
into the fire  that burnt as it were wood  
nor how the greekes with a huge rout 
three times riden all the fire about 
upon the left hand  with a loud shouting  
and thries with their speares clattering  
and thries how the ladies gan to cry  
nor how that led was homeward emily  
nor how arcite is burnt to ashes cold  
nor how the lyke wake was y hold 
all thilke night  nor how the greekes play 
the wake plays  ne keep i not to say  
who wrestled best naked  with oil anoint  
nor who that bare him best in no disjoint  
i will not tell eke how they all are gone 
home to athenes when the play is done  
but shortly to the point now will i wend  
and maken of my longe tale an end  
by process and by length of certain years 
all stinted is the mourning and the tears 
of greekes  by one general assent  
then seemed me there was a parlement 
at athens  upon certain points and cas  
amonge the which points y spoken was 
to have with certain countries alliance  
and have of thebans full obeisance  
for which this noble theseus anon 
let send after the gentle palamon  
unwist of him what was the cause and why  
but in his blacke clothes sorrowfully 
he came at his commandment on hie  
then sente theseus for emily  
when they were set  and hush d was all the place 
and theseus abided had a space 
ere any word came from his wise breast 
his eyen set he there as was his lest  
and with a sad visage he sighed still  wherever he pleased 
and after that right thus he said his will  
 the firste mover of the cause above 
when he first made the faire chain of love  
great was th  effect  and high was his intent  
well wist he why  and what thereof he meant  
for with that faire chain of love he bond 
the fire  the air  the water  and the lond 
in certain bondes  that they may not flee  
that same prince and mover eke   quoth he  
 hath stablish d  in this wretched world adown  
certain of dayes and duration 
to all that are engender d in this place  
over the whiche day they may not pace  
all may they yet their dayes well abridge  
there needeth no authority to allege 
for it is proved by experience  
but that me list declare my sentence  
then may men by this order well discern  
that thilke mover stable is and etern  
well may men know  but that it be a fool  
that every part deriveth from its whole  
for nature hath not ta en its beginning 
of no partie nor cantle of a thing  
but of a thing that perfect is and stable  
descending so  till it be corruptable  
and therefore of his wise purveyance 
he hath so well beset his ordinance  
that species of things and progressions 
shallen endure by successions  
and not etern  withouten any lie  
this mayst thou understand and see at eye  
lo th  oak  that hath so long a nourishing 
from the time that it  ginneth first to spring  
and hath so long a life  as ye may see  
yet at the last y wasted is the tree  
consider eke  how that the harde stone 
under our feet  on which we tread and gon  
yet wasteth  as it lieth by the way  
the broade river some time waxeth drey  
the greate townes see we wane and wend  
then may ye see that all things have an end  
of man and woman see we well also    
that needes in one of the termes two    
that is to say  in youth or else in age   
he must be dead  the king as shall a page  
some in his bed  some in the deepe sea  
some in the large field  as ye may see  
there helpeth nought  all go that ilke way  
then may i say that alle thing must die  
what maketh this but jupiter the king  
the which is prince  and cause of alle thing  
converting all unto his proper will  
from which it is derived  sooth to tell 
and hereagainst no creature alive  
of no degree  availeth for to strive  
then is it wisdom  as it thinketh me  
to make a virtue of necessity  
and take it well  that we may not eschew  
and namely what to us all is due  
and whoso grudgeth ought  he doth folly  
and rebel is to him that all may gie  
and certainly a man hath most honour 
to dien in his excellence and flower  
when he is sicker of his goode name  
then hath he done his friend  nor him  no shame 
and gladder ought his friend be of his death  
when with honour is yielded up his breath  
than when his name appalled is for age  
for all forgotten is his vassalage  
then is it best  as for a worthy fame  
to dien when a man is best of name  
the contrary of all this is wilfulness  
why grudge we  why have we heaviness  
that good arcite  of chivalry the flower  
departed is  with duty and honour  
out of this foule prison of this life  
why grudge here his cousin and his wife 
of his welfare  that loved him so well  
can he them thank  nay  god wot  neverdeal    
that both his soul and eke themselves offend  
and yet they may their lustes not amend  
what may i conclude of this longe serie  
but after sorrow i rede us to be merry  
and thanke jupiter for all his grace  
and ere that we departe from this place  
i rede that we make of sorrows two 
one perfect joye lasting evermo   
and look now where most sorrow is herein  
there will i first amenden and begin  
 sister   quoth he   this is my full assent  
with all th  advice here of my parlement  
that gentle palamon  your owen knight  
that serveth you with will  and heart  and might  
and ever hath  since first time ye him knew  
that ye shall of your grace upon him rue  
and take him for your husband and your lord  
lend me your hand  for this is our accord  
let see now of your womanly pity  
he is a kinge s brother s son  pardie  
and though he were a poore bachelere  
since he hath served you so many a year  
and had for you so great adversity  
it muste be considered   lieveth me  
for gentle mercy oweth to passen right   
then said he thus to palamon the knight  directed 
 i trow there needeth little sermoning 
to make you assente to this thing  
come near  and take your lady by the hand   
betwixte them was made anon the band  
that hight matrimony or marriage  
by all the counsel of the baronage  
and thus with alle bliss and melody 
hath palamon y wedded emily  
and god  that all this wide world hath wrought  
send him his love  that hath it dearly bought  
for now is palamon in all his weal  
living in bliss  in riches  and in heal  
and emily him loves so tenderly  
and he her serveth all so gentilly  
that never was there worde them between 
of jealousy  nor of none other teen  
thus endeth palamon and emily 
and god save all this faire company  
 
the miller s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
when that the knight had thus his tale told 
in all the rout was neither young nor old  
that he not said it was a noble story  
and worthy to be drawen to memory  
and namely the gentles every one  
our host then laugh d and swore   so may i gon  
this goes aright  unbuckled is the mail  
let see now who shall tell another tale  
for truely this game is well begun  
now telleth ye  sir monk  if that ye conne  
somewhat  to quiten with the knighte s tale   
the miller that fordrunken was all pale  
so that unnethes upon his horse he sat  
he would avalen neither hood nor hat  
nor abide no man for his courtesy  
but in pilate s voice he gan to cry  
and swore by armes  and by blood  and bones  
 i can a noble tale for the nones  
with which i will now quite the knighte s tale   
our host saw well how drunk he was of ale  
and said   robin  abide  my leve brother  
some better man shall tell us first another  
abide  and let us worke thriftily   
by godde s soul   quoth he   that will not i  
for i will speak  or elles go my way   
our host answer d   tell on a devil way  
thou art a fool  thy wit is overcome   
 now hearken   quoth the miller   all and some  
but first i make a protestatioun  
that i am drunk  i know it by my soun   
and therefore if that i misspeak or say  
wite it the ale of southwark  i you pray  
for i will tell a legend and a life 
both of a carpenter and of his wife  
how that a clerk hath set the wrighte s cap   
the reeve answer d and saide   stint thy clap  
let be thy lewed drunken harlotry  
it is a sin  and eke a great folly 
to apeiren any man  or him defame  
and eke to bringe wives in evil name  
thou may st enough of other thinges sayn   
this drunken miller spake full soon again  
and saide   leve brother osewold  
who hath no wife  he is no cuckold  
but i say not therefore that thou art one  
there be full goode wives many one  
why art thou angry with my tale now  
i have a wife  pardie  as well as thou  
yet n old i  for the oxen in my plough  
taken upon me more than enough  
to deemen of myself that i am one  
i will believe well that i am none  
an husband should not be inquisitive 
of godde s privity  nor of his wife  
so he may finde godde s foison there  
of the remnant needeth not to enquere   
what should i more say  but that this millere 
he would his wordes for no man forbear  
but told his churlish tale in his mannere  
me thinketh  that i shall rehearse it here  
and therefore every gentle wight i pray  
for godde s love to deem not that i say 
of evil intent  but that i must rehearse 
their tales all  be they better or worse  
or elles falsen some of my mattere  
and therefore whoso list it not to hear  
turn o er the leaf  and choose another tale  
for he shall find enough  both great and smale  
of storial thing that toucheth gentiless  
and eke morality and holiness  
blame not me  if that ye choose amiss  
the miller is a churl  ye know well this  
so was the reeve  with many other mo   
and harlotry they tolde bothe two  
avise you now  and put me out of blame  
and eke men should not make earnest of game  
 
the tale  
 
whilom there was dwelling in oxenford 
a riche gnof  that guestes held to board  
and of his craft he was a carpenter  
with him there was dwelling a poor scholer  
had learned art  but all his fantasy 
was turned for to learn astrology  
he coude a certain of conclusions 
to deeme by interrogations  
if that men asked him in certain hours  
when that men should have drought or elles show rs  
or if men asked him what shoulde fall 
of everything  i may not reckon all  
this clerk was called hendy nicholas  
of derne love he knew and of solace  
and therewith he was sly and full privy  
and like a maiden meek for to see  
a chamber had he in that hostelry 
alone  withouten any company  
full fetisly y dight with herbes swoot  
and he himself was sweet as is the root 
of liquorice  or any setewall  
his almagest  and bookes great and small  
his astrolabe  belonging to his art  
his augrim stones  layed fair apart 
on shelves couched at his bedde s head  
his press y cover d with a falding red  
and all above there lay a gay psalt ry 
on which he made at nightes melody  
so sweetely  that all the chamber rang  
and angelus ad virginem he sang  
and after that he sung the kinge s note  
full often blessed was his merry throat  
and thus this sweete clerk his time spent 
after his friendes finding and his rent  
 
this carpenter had wedded new a wife  
which that he loved more than his life  
of eighteen year  i guess  she was of age  
jealous he was  and held her narr w in cage  
for she was wild and young  and he was old  
and deemed himself belike a cuckold  
he knew not cato  for his wit was rude  
that bade a man wed his similitude  
men shoulde wedden after their estate  
for youth and eld are often at debate  
but since that he was fallen in the snare  
he must endure as other folk his care  
fair was this younge wife  and therewithal 
as any weasel her body gent and small  
a seint she weared  barred all of silk  
a barm cloth eke as white as morning milk 
upon her lendes  full of many a gore  
white was her smock  and broider d all before  
and eke behind  on her collar about 
of coal black silk  within and eke without  
the tapes of her white volupere 
were of the same suit of her collere  
her fillet broad of silk  and set full high  
and sickerly she had a likerous eye  
full small y pulled were her browes two  
and they were bent  and black as any sloe  
she was well more blissful on to see 
than is the newe perjenete tree  
and softer than the wool is of a wether  
and by her girdle hung a purse of leather  
tassel d with silk  and pearled with latoun  
in all this world to seeken up and down 
there is no man so wise  that coude thenche 
so gay a popelot  or such a wench  
full brighter was the shining of her hue  
than in the tower the noble forged new  
but of her song  it was as loud and yern  
as any swallow chittering on a bern  
thereto she coulde skip  and make a game 
as any kid or calf following his dame  
her mouth was sweet as braket  or as methe 
or hoard of apples  laid in hay or heath  
wincing she was as is a jolly colt  
long as a mast  and upright as a bolt  
a brooch she bare upon her low collere  
as broad as is the boss of a bucklere  
her shoon were laced on her legges high  
she was a primerole  a piggesnie  
for any lord t  have ligging in his bed  
or yet for any good yeoman to wed  
now  sir  and eft sir  so befell the case  
that on a day this hendy nicholas 
fell with this younge wife to rage and play  
while that her husband was at oseney  
as clerkes be full subtle and full quaint  
and privily he caught her by the queint  
and said   y wis  but if i have my will  
for derne love of thee  leman  i spill   
and helde her fast by the haunche bones  my mistress  i perish 
and saide  leman  love me well at once  
or i will dien  all so god me save   
and she sprang as a colt doth in the trave  
and with her head she writhed fast away  
and said   i will not kiss thee  by my fay  
why let be   quoth she   let be  nicholas  
or i will cry out harow and alas  
do away your handes  for your courtesy   
this nicholas gan mercy for to cry  
and spake so fair  and proffer d him so fast  
that she her love him granted at the last  
and swore her oath by saint thomas of kent  
that she would be at his commandement  
when that she may her leisure well espy  
 my husband is so full of jealousy  
that but ye waite well  and be privy  
i wot right well i am but dead   quoth she  
 ye muste be full derne as in this case   
 nay  thereof care thee nought   quoth nicholas  
 a clerk had litherly beset his while  
but if he could a carpenter beguile   
and thus they were accorded and y sworn 
to wait a time  as i have said beforn  
when nicholas had done thus every deal  
and thwacked her about the lendes well  
he kiss d her sweet  and taketh his psalt ry 
and playeth fast  and maketh melody  
then fell it thus  that to the parish church  
of christe s owen workes for to wirch  
this good wife went upon a holy day  
her forehead shone as bright as any day  
so was it washen  when she left her werk  
now was there of that church a parish clerk  
the which that was y cleped absolon  
curl d was his hair  and as the gold it shone  
and strutted as a fanne large and broad  
full straight and even lay his jolly shode  
his rode was red  his eyen grey as goose  
with paule s windows carven on his shoes 
in hosen red he went full fetisly  
y clad he was full small and properly  
all in a kirtle of a light waget  
full fair and thicke be the pointes set  
and thereupon he had a gay surplice  
as white as is the blossom on the rise  
a merry child he was  so god me save  
well could he letten blood  and clip  and shave  
and make a charter of land  and a quittance  
in twenty manners could he trip and dance  
after the school of oxenforde tho  
and with his legges caste to and fro  
and playen songes on a small ribible  
thereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible 
and as well could he play on a gitern  
in all the town was brewhouse nor tavern  
that he not visited with his solas  
there as that any garnard tapstere was  
but sooth to say he was somedeal squaimous 
of farting  and of speeche dangerous  
this absolon  that jolly was and gay  
went with a censer on the holy day  
censing the wives of the parish fast  
and many a lovely look he on them cast  
and namely on this carpenter s wife  
to look on her him thought a merry life  
she was so proper  and sweet  and likerous  
i dare well say  if she had been a mouse  
and he a cat  he would her hent anon  
this parish clerk  this jolly absolon  
hath in his hearte such a love longing  
that of no wife took he none offering  
for courtesy he said he woulde none  
the moon at night full clear and brighte shone  
and absolon his gitern hath y taken  
for paramours he thoughte for to waken  
and forth he went  jolif and amorous  
till he came to the carpentere s house  
a little after the cock had y crow  
and dressed him under a shot window  
that was upon the carpentere s wall  
he singeth in his voice gentle and small  
 now  dear lady  if thy will be  
i pray that ye will rue on me   
full well accordant to his giterning  
this carpenter awoke  and heard him sing  
and spake unto his wife  and said anon  
what alison  hear st thou not absolon  
that chanteth thus under our bower wall   
and she answer d her husband therewithal  
 yes  god wot  john  i hear him every deal   
this passeth forth  what will ye bet than well  
from day to day this jolly absolon 
so wooeth her  that him is woebegone  
he waketh all the night  and all the day  
to comb his lockes broad  and make him gay  
he wooeth her by means and by brocage  
and swore he woulde be her owen page  
he singeth brokking as a nightingale  
he sent her piment  mead  and spiced ale  
and wafers piping hot out of the glede  
and  for she was of town  he proffer d meed  
for some folk will be wonnen for richess  
and some for strokes  and some with gentiless  
sometimes  to show his lightness and mast ry  
he playeth herod on a scaffold high  
but what availeth him as in this case  
so loveth she the hendy nicholas  
that absolon may blow the bucke s horn  
he had for all his labour but a scorn  
and thus she maketh absolon her ape  
and all his earnest turneth to a jape  
full sooth is this proverb  it is no lie  
men say right thus alway  the nighe sly 
maketh oft time the far lief to be loth  
for though that absolon be wood or wroth 
because that he far was from her sight  
this nigh nicholas stood still in his light  
now bear thee well  thou hendy nicholas  
for absolon may wail and sing  alas   
and so befell  that on a saturday 
this carpenter was gone to oseney  
and hendy nicholas and alison 
accorded were to this conclusion  
that nicholas shall shape him a wile 
the silly jealous husband to beguile  
and if so were the game went aright  
she shoulde sleepen in his arms all night  
for this was her desire and his also  
and right anon  withoute wordes mo   
this nicholas no longer would he tarry  
but doth full soft unto his chamber carry 
both meat and drinke for a day or tway  
and to her husband bade her for to say  
if that he asked after nicholas  
she shoulde say   she wist not where he was  
of all the day she saw him not with eye  
she trowed he was in some malady  
for no cry that her maiden could him call 
he would answer  for nought that might befall   
thus passed forth all thilke saturday  
that nicholas still in his chamber lay  
and ate  and slept  and didde what him list 
till sunday  that the sunne went to rest  
this silly carpenter had great marvaill 
of nicholas  or what thing might him ail  
and said   i am adrad  by saint thomas  
it standeth not aright with nicholas  
god shielde that he died suddenly  
this world is now full fickle sickerly  
i saw to day a corpse y borne to chirch  
that now on monday last i saw him wirch  
 go up   quod he unto his knave   anon  
clepe at his door  or knocke with a stone  
look how it is  and tell me boldely   
this knave went him up full sturdily  
and  at the chamber door while that he stood  
he cried and knocked as that he were wood  
 what how  what do ye  master nicholay  
how may ye sleepen all the longe day   
but all for nought  he hearde not a word  
an hole he found full low upon the board  
where as the cat was wont in for to creep  
and at that hole he looked in full deep  
and at the last he had of him a sight  
this nicholas sat ever gaping upright  
as he had kyked on the newe moon  
adown he went  and told his master soon  
in what array he saw this ilke man  
this carpenter to blissen him began  
and said   now help us  sainte frideswide  
a man wot little what shall him betide  
this man is fall n with his astronomy 
into some woodness or some agony  
i thought aye well how that it shoulde be  
men should know nought of godde s privity  
yea  blessed be alway a lewed man  
that nought but only his believe can  
so far d another clerk with astronomy  than his  credo   
he walked in the fieldes for to 
upon the starres  what there should befall  
till he was in a marle pit y fall  
he saw not that  but yet  by saint thomas  
me rueth sore of hendy nicholas  
he shall be rated of his studying  
if that i may  by jesus  heaven s king  
get me a staff  that i may underspore 
while that thou  robin  heavest off the door  
he shall out of his studying  as i guess   
and to the chamber door he gan him dress  
his knave was a strong carl for the nonce  
and by the hasp he heav d it off at once  
into the floor the door fell down anon  
this nicholas sat aye as still as stone  
and ever he gap d upward into the air  
the carpenter ween d he were in despair  
and hent him by the shoulders mightily  
and shook him hard  and cried spitously  
 what  nicholas  what how  man  look adown  
awake  and think on christe s passioun  
i crouche thee from elves  and from wights  
therewith the night spell said he anon rights  
on the four halves of the house about  
and on the threshold of the door without  
 lord jesus christ  and sainte benedight  
blesse this house from every wicked wight  
from the night mare  the white pater noster  
where wonnest thou now  sainte peter s sister   
and at the last this hendy nicholas 
gan for to sigh full sore  and said   alas  
shall all time world be lost eftsoones now   
this carpenter answer d   what sayest thou  
what  think on god  as we do  men that swink   
this nicholas answer d   fetch me a drink  
and after will i speak in privity 
of certain thing that toucheth thee and me  
i will tell it no other man certain   
this carpenter went down  and came again  
and brought of mighty ale a large quart  
and when that each of them had drunk his part  
this nicholas his chamber door fast shet  
and down the carpenter by him he set  
and saide   john  mine host full lief and dear  
thou shalt upon thy truthe swear me here  
that to no wight thou shalt my counsel wray  
for it is christes counsel that i say  
and if thou tell it man  thou art forlore  
for this vengeance thou shalt have therefor  
that if thou wraye me  thou shalt be wood   
 nay  christ forbid it for his holy blood   
quoth then this silly man   i am no blab  
nor  though i say it  am i lief to gab  
say what thou wilt  i shall it never tell 
to child or wife  by him that harried hell   
 now  john   quoth nicholas   i will not lie  
i have y found in my astrology  
as i have looked in the moone bright  
that now on monday next  at quarter night  
shall fall a rain  and that so wild and wood  
that never half so great was noe s flood  
this world   he said   in less than half an hour 
shall all be dreint  so hideous is the shower  
thus shall mankinde drench  and lose their life   
this carpenter answer d   alas  my wife  
and shall she drench  alas  mine alisoun   
for sorrow of this he fell almost adown  
and said   is there no remedy in this case   
 why  yes  for god   quoth hendy nicholas  
 if thou wilt worken after lore and rede  
thou may st not worken after thine own head  
for thus saith solomon  that was full true  
work all by counsel  and thou shalt not rue  
and if thou worke wilt by good counseil  
i undertake  withoute mast or sail  
yet shall i save her  and thee  and me  
hast thou not heard how saved was noe  
when that our lord had warned him beforn  
that all the world with water should be lorn   
 yes   quoth this carpenter   full yore ago   
 hast thou not heard   quoth nicholas   also 
the sorrow of noe  with his fellowship  
that he had ere he got his wife to ship  
him had been lever  i dare well undertake  
at thilke time  than all his wethers black  
that she had had a ship herself alone  
and therefore know st thou what is best to be done  
this asketh haste  and of an hasty thing 
men may not preach or make tarrying  
anon go get us fast into this inn 
a kneading trough  or else a kemelin  
for each of us  but look that they be large  
in whiche we may swim as in a barge  
and have therein vitaille suffisant 
but for one day  fie on the remenant  
the water shall aslake and go away 
aboute prime upon the nexte day  
but robin may not know of this  thy knave  
nor eke thy maiden gill i may not save  
ask me not why  for though thou aske me 
i will not telle godde s privity  
sufficeth thee  but if thy wit be mad  
to have as great a grace as noe had  out of thy wits 
thy wife shall i well saven out of doubt  
go now thy way  and speed thee hereabout  
but when thou hast for her  and thee  and me  
y gotten us these kneading tubbes three  
then shalt thou hang them in the roof full high  
so that no man our purveyance espy  foresight  providence 
and when thou hast done thus as i have said  
and hast our vitaille fair in them y laid  
and eke an axe to smite the cord in two 
when that the water comes  that we may go  
and break an hole on high upon the gable 
into the garden ward  over the stable  
that we may freely passe forth our way  
when that the greate shower is gone away  
then shalt thou swim as merry  i undertake  
as doth the white duck after her drake  
then will i clepe   how  alison  how  john  
be merry  for the flood will pass anon   
and thou wilt say   hail  master nicholay  
good morrow  i see thee well  for it is day   
and then shall we be lordes all our life 
of all the world  as noe and his wife  
but of one thing i warne thee full right  
be well advised  on that ilke night  
when we be enter d into shippe s board  
that none of us not speak a single word  
nor clepe nor cry  but be in his prayere  
for that is godde s owen heste dear  
thy wife and thou must hangen far atween  
for that betwixte you shall be no sin  
no more in looking than there shall in deed  
this ordinance is said  go  god thee speed 
to morrow night  when men be all asleep  
into our kneading tubbes will we creep  
and sitte there  abiding godde s grace  
go now thy way  i have no longer space 
to make of this no longer sermoning  
men say thus  send the wise  and say nothing  
thou art so wise  it needeth thee nought teach  
go  save our lives  and that i thee beseech   
this silly carpenter went forth his way  
full oft he said   alas  and well a day    
and to his wife he told his privity  
and she was ware  and better knew than he 
what all this quainte cast was for to say  
but natheless she fear d as she would dey  meant 
and said   alas  go forth thy way anon  
help us to scape  or we be dead each one  
i am thy true and very wedded wife  
go  deare spouse  and help to save our life   
lo  what a great thing is affection  
men may die of imagination  
so deeply may impression be take  
this silly carpenter begins to quake  
he thinketh verily that he may see 
this newe flood come weltering as the sea 
to drenchen alison  his honey dear  
he weepeth  waileth  maketh sorry cheer  
he sigheth  with full many a sorry sough  
he go th  and getteth him a kneading trough  
and after that a tub  and a kemelin  
and privily he sent them to his inn  
and hung them in the roof full privily  
with his own hand then made he ladders three  
to climbe by the ranges and the stalks 
unto the tubbes hanging in the balks  
and victualed them  kemelin  trough  and tub  
with bread and cheese  and good ale in a jub  
sufficing right enough as for a day  
but ere that he had made all this array  
he sent his knave  and eke his wench also  
upon his need to london for to go  
and on the monday  when it drew to night  
he shut his door withoute candle light  
and dressed every thing as it should be  
and shortly up they climbed all the three  
they satte stille well a furlong way  
 now  pater noster  clum   said nicholay  to walk a furlong 
and  clum   quoth john  and  clum   said alison  
this carpenter said his devotion  
and still he sat and bidded his prayere  
awaking on the rain  if he it hear  
the deade sleep  for weary business  
fell on this carpenter  right as i guess  
about the curfew time  or little more  
for travail of his ghost he groaned sore  
and eft he routed  for his head mislay  
adown the ladder stalked nicholay  for his head lay awry 
and alison full soft adown she sped  
withoute wordes more they went to bed  
there as the carpenter was wont to lie  
there was the revel  and the melody  
and thus lay alison and nicholas  
in business of mirth and in solace  
until the bell of laudes gan to ring  
and friars in the chancel went to sing  
this parish clerk  this amorous absolon  
that is for love alway so woebegone  
upon the monday was at oseney 
with company  him to disport and play  
and asked upon cas a cloisterer 
full privily after john the carpenter  
and he drew him apart out of the church  
and said   i n ot  i saw him not here wirch 
since saturday  i trow that he be went 
for timber  where our abbot hath him sent  
and dwellen at the grange a day or two  
for he is wont for timber for to go  
or else he is at his own house certain  
where that he be  i cannot soothly sayn   
this absolon full jolly was and light  
and thought   now is the time to wake all night  
for sickerly i saw him not stirring 
about his door  since day began to spring  
so may i thrive  but i shall at cock crow 
full privily go knock at his window  
that stands full low upon his bower wall  
to alison then will i tellen all 
my love longing  for i shall not miss 
that at the leaste way i shall her kiss  
some manner comfort shall i have  parfay  
my mouth hath itched all this livelong day  
that is a sign of kissing at the least  
all night i mette eke i was at a feast  
therefore i will go sleep an hour or tway  
and all the night then will i wake and play   
when that the first cock crowed had  anon 
up rose this jolly lover absolon  
and him arrayed gay  at point devise  
but first he chewed grains and liquorice  
to smelle sweet  ere he had combed his hair  
under his tongue a true love he bare  
for thereby thought he to be gracious  
then came he to the carpentere s house  
and still he stood under the shot window  
unto his breast it raught  it was so low  
and soft he coughed with a semisoun   
 what do ye  honeycomb  sweet alisoun  
my faire bird  my sweet cinamome  
awaken  leman mine  and speak to me  
full little thinke ye upon my woe  
that for your love i sweat there as i go  
no wonder is that i do swelt and sweat  
i mourn as doth a lamb after the teat 
y wis  leman  i have such love longing  
that like a turtle true is my mourning  
i may not eat  no more than a maid   
 go from the window  thou jack fool   she said  
 as help me god  it will not be   come ba me   
i love another  else i were to blame   
well better than thee  by jesus  absolon  
go forth thy way  or i will cast a stone  
and let me sleep  a twenty devil way  
 alas   quoth absolon   and well away  
that true love ever was so ill beset  
then kiss me  since that it may be no bet  
for jesus  love  and for the love of me   
 wilt thou then go thy way therewith    quoth she  
 yea  certes  leman   quoth this absolon  
 then make thee ready   quoth she   i come anon   
 and unto nicholas she said full still  
 now peace  and thou shalt laugh anon thy fill    
this absolon down set him on his knees  
and said   i am a lord at all degrees  
for after this i hope there cometh more  
leman  thy grace  and  sweete bird  thine ore   
the window she undid  and that in haste  
 have done   quoth she   come off  and speed thee fast  
lest that our neighebours should thee espy   
then absolon gan wipe his mouth full dry  
dark was the night as pitch or as the coal  
and at the window she put out her hole  
and absolon him fell ne bet ne werse  
but with his mouth he kiss d her naked erse 
full savourly  when he was ware of this  
aback he start  and thought it was amiss  
for well he wist a woman hath no beard  
he felt a thing all rough  and long y hair d  
and saide   fy  alas  what have i do   
 te he   quoth she  and clapt the window to  
and absolon went forth at sorry pace  
 a beard  a beard   said hendy nicholas  
 by god s corpus  this game went fair and well   
this silly absolon heard every deal  
and on his lip he gan for anger bite  
and to himself he said   i shall thee quite  
who rubbeth now  who frotteth now his lips 
with dust  with sand  with straw  with cloth  with chips  
but absolon  that saith full oft   alas  
my soul betake i unto sathanas  
but me were lever than all this town   quoth he 
i this despite awroken for to be  
alas  alas  that i have been y blent   
his hote love is cold  and all y quent  
for from that time that he had kiss d her erse  
of paramours he sette not a kers  
for he was healed of his malady  
full often paramours he gan defy  
and weep as doth a child that hath been beat  
a softe pace he went over the street 
unto a smith  men callen dan gerveis  
that in his forge smithed plough harness  
he sharped share and culter busily  
this absolon knocked all easily  
and said   undo  gerveis  and that anon   
 what  who art thou    it is i  absolon   
 what  absolon  what  christe s sweete tree  
why rise so rath  hey  benedicite  
what aileth you  some gay girl  god it wote  
hath brought you thus upon the viretote  
by saint neot  ye wot well what i mean   
this absolon he raughte not a bean 
of all his play  no word again he gaf  
for he had more tow on his distaff 
than gerveis knew  and saide   friend so dear  
that hote culter in the chimney here 
lend it to me  i have therewith to don  
i will it bring again to thee full soon   
gerveis answered   certes  were it gold  
or in a poke nobles all untold  
thou shouldst it have  as i am a true smith  
hey  christe s foot  what will ye do therewith   
 thereof   quoth absolon   be as be may  
i shall well tell it thee another day   
and caught the culter by the colde stele  
full soft out at the door he gan to steal  
and went unto the carpentere s wall 
he coughed first  and knocked therewithal 
upon the window  light as he did ere  
this alison answered   who is there 
that knocketh so  i warrant him a thief   
 nay  nay   quoth he   god wot  my sweete lefe  
i am thine absolon  my own darling  
of gold   quoth he   i have thee brought a ring  
my mother gave it me  so god me save  
full fine it is  and thereto well y grave  
this will i give to thee  if thou me kiss   
now nicholas was risen up to piss  
and thought he would amenden all the jape  
he shoulde kiss his erse ere that he scape  
and up the window did he hastily  
and out his erse he put full privily 
over the buttock  to the haunche bone  
and therewith spake this clerk  this absolon  
 speak  sweete bird  i know not where thou art   
this nicholas anon let fly a fart  
as great as it had been a thunder dent  
that with the stroke he was well nigh y blent  
but he was ready with his iron hot  
and nicholas amid the erse he smote  
off went the skin an handbreadth all about  
the hote culter burned so his tout  
that for the smart he weened he would die  
as he were wood  for woe he gan to cry  
 help  water  water  help for godde s heart   
this carpenter out of his slumber start  
and heard one cry  water   as he were wood  
and thought   alas  now cometh noe s flood   
he sat him up withoute wordes mo  
and with his axe he smote the cord in two  
and down went all  he found neither to sell 
nor bread nor ale  till he came to the sell  
upon the floor  and there in swoon he lay  
up started alison and nicholay  
and cried out an  harow   in the street  
the neighbours alle  bothe small and great 
in ranne  for to gauren on this man  
that yet in swoone lay  both pale and wan  
for with the fall he broken had his arm  
but stand he must unto his owen harm  
for when he spake  he was anon borne down 
with hendy nicholas and alisoun  
they told to every man that he was wood  
he was aghaste so of noe s flood  
through phantasy  that of his vanity 
he had y bought him kneading tubbes three  
and had them hanged in the roof above  
and that he prayed them for godde s love 
to sitten in the roof for company  
the folk gan laughen at his phantasy  
into the roof they kyken and they gape  
and turned all his harm into a jape  
for whatsoe er this carpenter answer d  
it was for nought  no man his reason heard  
with oathes great he was so sworn adown  
that he was holden wood in all the town  
for every clerk anon right held with other  
they said   the man was wood  my leve brother   
and every wight gan laughen at his strife  
thus swived was the carpentere s wife  
for all his keeping and his jealousy  
and absolon hath kiss d her nether eye  
and nicholas is scalded in the tout  
this tale is done  and god save all the rout  
 
the reeve s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
when folk had laughed all at this nice case 
of absolon and hendy nicholas  
diverse folk diversely they said  
but for the more part they laugh d and play d  
and at this tale i saw no man him grieve  
but it were only osewold the reeve  
because he was of carpenteres craft  
a little ire is in his hearte laft  
he gan to grudge and blamed it a lite  
 so the i   quoth he   full well could i him quite 
with blearing of a proude miller s eye  
if that me list to speak of ribaldry  
but i am old  me list not play for age  
grass time is done  my fodder is now forage  
this white top writeth mine olde years  
mine heart is also moulded as mine hairs  
and i do fare as doth an open erse  
that ilke fruit is ever longer werse  
till it be rotten in mullok or in stre  
we olde men  i dread  so fare we  
till we be rotten  can we not be ripe  
we hop away  while that the world will pipe  
for in our will there sticketh aye a nail  
to have an hoary head and a green tail  
as hath a leek  for though our might be gone  
our will desireth folly ever in one  
for when we may not do  then will we speak  
yet in our ashes cold does fire reek  
four gledes have we  which i shall devise  
vaunting  and lying  anger  covetise  
these foure sparks belongen unto eld  
our olde limbes well may be unweld  
but will shall never fail us  that is sooth  
and yet have i alway a coltes tooth  
as many a year as it is passed and gone 
since that my tap of life began to run  
for sickerly  when i was born  anon 
death drew the tap of life  and let it gon  
and ever since hath so the tap y run  
till that almost all empty is the tun  
the stream of life now droppeth on the chimb  
the silly tongue well may ring and chime 
of wretchedness  that passed is full yore  
with olde folk  save dotage  is no more  
when that our host had heard this sermoning  
he gan to speak as lordly as a king  
and said   to what amounteth all this wit  
what  shall we speak all day of holy writ  
the devil made a reeve for to preach  
as of a souter a shipman  or a leach  
say forth thy tale  and tarry not the time  
lo here is deptford  and  tis half past prime  
lo greenwich  where many a shrew is in  
it were high time thy tale to begin   
 now  sirs   quoth then this osewold the reeve  
i pray you all that none of you do grieve  
though i answer  and somewhat set his hove  
for lawful is force off with force to shove  
this drunken miller hath y told us here by force 
how that beguiled was a carpentere  
paraventure in scorn  for i am one  
and  by your leave  i shall him quite anon  
right in his churlish termes will i speak  
i pray to god his necke might to break  
he can well in mine eye see a stalk  
but in his own he cannot see a balk   
 
the tale  
 
at trompington  not far from cantebrig  
there goes a brook  and over that a brig  
upon the whiche brook there stands a mill  
and this is very sooth that i you tell  
a miller was there dwelling many a day  
as any peacock he was proud and gay  
pipen he could  and fish  and nettes bete  
and turne cups  and wrestle well  and shete  
aye by his belt he bare a long pavade  
and of his sword full trenchant was the blade  
a jolly popper bare he in his pouch  
there was no man for peril durst him touch  
a sheffield whittle bare he in his hose  
round was his face  and camuse was his nose  
as pilled as an ape s was his skull  
he was a market beter at the full  
there durste no wight hand upon him legge  
that he ne swore anon he should abegge  
a thief he was  for sooth  of corn and meal  
and that a sly  and used well to steal  
his name was hoten deinous simekin 
a wife he hadde  come of noble kin  
the parson of the town her father was  
with her he gave full many a pan of brass  
for that simkin should in his blood ally  
she was y foster d in a nunnery  
for simkin woulde no wife  as he said  
but she were well y nourish d  and a maid  
to saven his estate and yeomanry  
and she was proud  and pert as is a pie  
a full fair sight it was to see them two  
on holy days before her would he go 
with his tippet y bound about his head  
and she came after in a gite of red  
and simkin hadde hosen of the same  
there durste no wight call her aught but dame  
none was so hardy  walking by that way  
that with her either durste rage or play  
but if he would be slain by simekin 
with pavade  or with knife  or bodekin  
for jealous folk be per lous evermo   
algate they would their wives wende so  
and eke for she was somewhat smutterlich  
she was as dign as water in a ditch  
and all so full of hoker  and bismar  
her thoughte that a lady should her spare  
what for her kindred  and her nortelrie 
that she had learned in the nunnery  
one daughter hadde they betwixt them two 
of twenty year  withouten any mo  
saving a child that was of half year age  
in cradle it lay  and was a proper page  
this wenche thick and well y growen was  
with camuse nose  and eyen gray as glass  
with buttocks broad  and breastes round and high  
but right fair was her hair  i will not lie  
the parson of the town  for she was fair  
in purpose was to make of her his heir 
both of his chattels and his messuage  
and strange he made it of her marriage  
his purpose was for to bestow her high of difficulty 
into some worthy blood of ancestry  
for holy church s good may be dispended 
on holy church s blood that is descended  
therefore he would his holy blood honour 
though that he holy churche should devour  
great soken hath this miller  out of doubt  
with wheat and malt  of all the land about  
and namely there was a great college 
men call the soler hall at cantebrege  
there was their wheat and eke their malt y ground  
and on a day it happed in a stound  
sick lay the manciple of a malady  
men weened wisly that he shoulde die  
for which this miller stole both meal and corn 
an hundred times more than beforn  
for theretofore he stole but courteously  
but now he was a thief outrageously  
for which the warden chid and made fare  
but thereof set the miller not a tare  
he crack d his boast  and swore it was not so  
then were there younge poore scholars two  
that dwelled in the hall of which i say  
testif they were  and lusty for to play  
and only for their mirth and revelry 
upon the warden busily they cry  
to give them leave for but a little stound  
to go to mill  and see their corn y ground  
and hardily they durste lay their neck  
the miller should not steal them half a peck 
of corn by sleight  nor them by force bereave 
and at the last the warden give them leave  
john hight the one  and alein hight the other  
of one town were they born  that highte strother  
far in the north  i cannot tell you where  
this alein he made ready all his gear  
and on a horse the sack he cast anon  
forth went alein the clerk  and also john  
with good sword and with buckler by their side  
john knew the way  him needed not no guide  
and at the mill the sack adown he lay th  
alein spake first   all hail  simon  in faith  
how fares thy faire daughter  and thy wife   
 alein  welcome   quoth simkin   by my life  
and john also  how now  what do ye here   
 by god  simon   quoth john   need has no peer  
him serve himself behoves that has no swain  
or else he is a fool  as clerkes sayn  
our manciple i hope he will be dead  
so workes aye the wanges in his head 
and therefore is i come  and eke alein  
to grind our corn and carry it home again  
i pray you speed us hence as well ye may   
 it shall be done   quoth simkin   by my fay  
what will ye do while that it is in hand   
 by god  right by the hopper will i stand   
quoth john   and see how that the corn goes in  
yet saw i never  by my father s kin  
how that the hopper wagges to and fro   
alein answered   john  and wilt thou so  
then will i be beneathe  by my crown  
and see how that the meale falls adown 
into the trough  that shall be my disport  
for  john  in faith i may be of your sort  
i is as ill a miller as is ye   
this miller smiled at their nicety  
and thought   all this is done but for a wile  
they weenen that no man may them beguile  
but by my thrift yet shall i blear their eye  
for all the sleight in their philosophy  
the more quainte knackes that they make  
the more will i steal when that i take  
instead of flour yet will i give them bren  
the greatest clerks are not the wisest men  
as whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare  
of all their art ne count i not a tare   
out at the door he went full privily  
when that he saw his time  softely  
he looked up and down  until he found 
the clerkes  horse  there as he stood y bound 
behind the mill  under a levesell  
and to the horse he went him fair and well  
and stripped off the bridle right anon  
and when the horse was loose  he gan to gon 
toward the fen  where wilde mares run  
forth  with  wehee   through thick and eke through thin  
this miller went again  no word he said  
but did his note  and with these clerkes play d  
till that their corn was fair and well y ground  
and when the meal was sacked and y bound  
then john went out  and found his horse away  
and gan to cry   harow  and well away  
our horse is lost  alein  for godde s bones  
step on thy feet  come off  man  all at once  
alas  our warden has his palfrey lorn   
this alein all forgot  both meal and corn  
all was out of his mind his husbandry  
 what  which way is he gone   he gan to cry  
the wife came leaping inward at a renne  
she said   alas  your horse went to the fen 
with wilde mares  as fast as he could go  
unthank come on his hand that bound him so 
and his that better should have knit the rein   
 alas   quoth john   alein  for christes pain 
lay down thy sword  and i shall mine also  
i is full wight  god wate  as is a roe  
by godde s soul he shall not scape us bathe  
why n  had thou put the capel in the lathe  
ill hail  alein  by god thou is a fonne   
these silly clerkes have full fast y run 
toward the fen  both alein and eke john  
and when the miller saw that they were gone  
he half a bushel of their flour did take  
and bade his wife go knead it in a cake  
he said  i trow  the clerkes were afeard  
yet can a miller make a clerkes beard  
for all his art  yea  let them go their way  
lo where they go  yea  let the children play  
they get him not so lightly  by my crown   
these silly clerkes runnen up and down 
with  keep  keep  stand  stand  jossa  warderere  
go whistle thou  and i shall keep him here   
but shortly  till that it was very night 
they coulde not  though they did all their might  
their capel catch  he ran alway so fast  
till in a ditch they caught him at the last  
weary and wet  as beastes in the rain  
comes silly john  and with him comes alein  
 alas   quoth john   the day that i was born  
now are we driv n till hething and till scorn  
our corn is stol n  men will us fonnes call  
both the warden  and eke our fellows all  
and namely the miller  well away   
thus plained john  as he went by the way 
toward the mill  and bayard in his hand  
the miller sitting by the fire he fand  
for it was night  and forther might they not  
but for the love of god they him besought 
of herberow and ease  for their penny  
the miller said again   if there be any  
such as it is  yet shall ye have your part  
mine house is strait  but ye have learned art  
ye can by arguments maken a place 
a mile broad  of twenty foot of space  
let see now if this place may suffice  
or make it room with speech  as is your guise   
 now  simon   said this john   by saint cuthberd 
aye is thou merry  and that is fair answer d  
i have heard say  man shall take of two things  
such as he findes  or such as he brings  
but specially i pray thee  hoste dear  
gar us have meat and drink  and make us cheer  
and we shall pay thee truly at the full  
with empty hand men may not hawkes tull  
lo here our silver ready for to spend   
this miller to the town his daughter send 
for ale and bread  and roasted them a goose  
and bound their horse  he should no more go loose  
and them in his own chamber made a bed  
with sheetes and with chalons fair y spread  
not from his owen bed ten foot or twelve  
his daughter had a bed all by herselve  
right in the same chamber by and by  
it might no better be  and cause why  
there was no roomer herberow in the place  
they suppen  and they speaken of solace  
and drinken ever strong ale at the best  
aboute midnight went they all to rest  
well had this miller varnished his head  
full pale he was  fordrunken  and nought red  
he yoxed  and he spake thorough the nose  
as he were in the quakke  or in the pose  
to bed he went  and with him went his wife  
as any jay she light was and jolife  
so was her jolly whistle well y wet  
the cradle at her beddes feet was set  
to rock  and eke to give the child to suck  
and when that drunken was all in the crock 
to bedde went the daughter right anon  
to bedde went alein  and also john  
there was no more  needed them no dwale  
this miller had  so wisly bibbed ale  
that as a horse he snorted in his sleep  
nor of his tail behind he took no keep  
his wife bare him a burdoun  a full strong  
men might their routing hearen a furlong  
the wenche routed eke for company  
alein the clerk  that heard this melody  
he poked john  and saide   sleepest thou  
heardest thou ever such a song ere now  
lo what a compline is y mell them all  
a wilde fire upon their bodies fall  
who hearken d ever such a ferly thing  
yea  they shall have the flow r of ill ending  
this longe night there tides me no rest  
but yet no force  all shall be for the best  
for  john   said he   as ever may i thrive  
if that i may  yon wenche will i swive  
some easement has law y shapen us 
for  john  there is a law that sayeth thus  
that if a man in one point be aggriev d  
that in another he shall be relievd  
our corn is stol n  soothly it is no nay  
and we have had an evil fit to day  
and since i shall have none amendement 
against my loss  i will have easement  
by godde s soul  it shall none  other be   
this john answer d  alein  avise thee  
the miller is a perilous man   he said  
 and if that he out of his sleep abraid  
he mighte do us both a villainy   
alein answer d   i count him not a fly  
and up he rose  and by the wench he crept  
this wenche lay upright  and fast she slept  
till he so nigh was  ere she might espy  
that it had been too late for to cry  
and  shortly for to say  they were at one  
now play  alein  for i will speak of john  
this john lay still a furlong way or two  
and to himself he made ruth and woe  
 alas   quoth he   this is a wicked jape  
now may i say  that i is but an ape  
yet has my fellow somewhat for his harm  
he has the miller s daughter in his arm  
he auntred him  and hath his needes sped  
and i lie as a draff sack in my bed  
and when this jape is told another day  
i shall be held a daffe or a cockenay 
i will arise  and auntre it  by my fay  
unhardy is unsely  as men say   
and up he rose  and softely he went 
unto the cradle  and in his hand it hent  
and bare it soft unto his beddes feet  
soon after this the wife her routing lete  
and gan awake  and went her out to piss 
and came again and gan the cradle miss 
and groped here and there  but she found none  
 alas   quoth she   i had almost misgone 
i had almost gone to the clerkes  bed  
ey  benedicite  then had i foul y sped   
and forth she went  till she the cradle fand  
she groped alway farther with her hand 
and found the bed  and thoughte not but good 
because that the cradle by it stood  
and wist not where she was  for it was derk  
but fair and well she crept in by the clerk  
and lay full still  and would have caught a sleep  
within a while this john the clerk up leap 
and on this goode wife laid on full sore  
so merry a fit had she not had full yore  
he pricked hard and deep  as he were mad  
this jolly life have these two clerkes had  
till that the thirde cock began to sing  
alein wax d weary in the morrowing  
for he had swonken all the longe night  
and saide   farewell  malkin  my sweet wight  
the day is come  i may no longer bide  
but evermore  where so i go or ride  
i is thine owen clerk  so have i hele   
 now  deare leman   quoth she   go  fare wele  
but ere thou go  one thing i will thee tell  
when that thou wendest homeward by the mill  
right at the entry of the door behind 
thou shalt a cake of half a bushel find  
that was y maked of thine owen meal  
which that i help d my father for to steal  
and goode leman  god thee save and keep   
and with that word she gan almost to weep  
alein uprose and thought   ere the day daw 
i will go creepen in by my fellaw   
and found the cradle with his hand anon  
 by god   thought he   all wrong i have misgone  
my head is totty of my swink to night  
that maketh me that i go not aright  
i wot well by the cradle i have misgo   
here lie the miller and his wife also   
and forth he went a twenty devil way 
unto the bed  there as the miller lay  
he ween d t  have creeped by his fellow john  
and by the miller in he crept anon  
and caught him by the neck  and gan him shake  
and said   thou john  thou swines head  awake 
for christes soul  and hear a noble game  
for by that lord that called is saint jame  
as i have thries in this shorte night 
swived the miller s daughter bolt upright  
while thou hast as a coward lain aghast   
 thou false harlot   quoth the miller   hast  
ah  false traitor  false clerk   quoth he  
 thou shalt be dead  by godde s dignity  
who durste be so bold to disparage 
my daughter  that is come of such lineage   
and by the throate ball he caught alein  
and he him hent dispiteously again  
and on the nose he smote him with his fist  
down ran the bloody stream upon his breast  
and in the floor with nose and mouth all broke 
they wallow  as do two pigs in a poke  
and up they go  and down again anon  
till that the miller spurned on a stone  
and down he backward fell upon his wife  
that wiste nothing of this nice strife  
for she was fall n asleep a little wight 
with john the clerk  that waked had all night  
and with the fall out of her sleep she braid  
 help  holy cross of bromeholm   she said  
 in manus tuas   lord  to thee i call  
awake  simon  the fiend is on me fall  
mine heart is broken  help  i am but dead  
there li th one on my womb and on mine head  
help  simkin  for these false clerks do fight  
this john start up as fast as e er he might  
and groped by the walles to and fro 
to find a staff  and she start up also  
and knew the estres better than this john  
and by the wall she took a staff anon  
and saw a little shimmering of a light  
for at an hole in shone the moone bright  
and by that light she saw them both the two  
but sickerly she wist not who was who  
but as she saw a white thing in her eye  
and when she gan this white thing espy  
she ween d the clerk had wear d a volupere  
and with the staff she drew aye nere and nere  
and ween d to have hit this alein at the full  
and smote the miller on the pilled skull  
that down he went  and cried   harow  i die   
these clerkes beat him well  and let him lie  
and greithen them  and take their horse anon  
and eke their meal  and on their way they gon  
and at the mill door eke they took their cake 
of half a bushel flour  full well y bake  
thus is the proude miller well y beat  
and hath y lost the grinding of the wheat  
and payed for the supper every deal 
of alein and of john  that beat him well  
his wife is swived  and his daughter als  
lo  such it is a miller to be false  
and therefore this proverb is said full sooth  
 him thar not winnen well that evil do th  
a guiler shall himself beguiled be   
and god that sitteth high in majesty 
save all this company  both great and smale  
thus have i quit the miller in my tale  
 
the cook s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
the cook of london  while the reeve thus spake  
for joy he laugh d and clapp d him on the back  
 aha   quoth he   for christes passion  
this miller had a sharp conclusion  
upon this argument of herbergage  
well saide solomon in his language  
bring thou not every man into thine house  
for harbouring by night is perilous  
well ought a man avised for to be 
whom that he brought into his privity  
i pray to god to give me sorrow and care 
if ever  since i highte hodge of ware  
heard i a miller better set a work  
he had a jape of malice in the derk  
but god forbid that we should stinte here  
and therefore if ye will vouchsafe to hear 
a tale of me  that am a poore man  
i will you tell as well as e er i can 
a little jape that fell in our city   
our host answer d and said   i grant it thee  
roger  tell on  and look that it be good  
for many a pasty hast thou letten blood  
and many a jack of dover hast thou sold  
that had been twice hot and twice cold  
of many a pilgrim hast thou christe s curse  
for of thy parsley yet fare they the worse  
that they have eaten in thy stubble goose  
for in thy shop doth many a fly go loose  
now tell on  gentle roger  by thy name  
but yet i pray thee be not wroth for game  
a man may say full sooth in game and play   
 thou sayst full sooth   quoth roger   by my fay  
but sooth play quad play  as the fleming saith  
and therefore  harry bailly  by thy faith  
be thou not wroth  else we departe here  
though that my tale be of an hostelere  
but natheless  i will not tell it yet  
but ere we part  y wis thou shalt be quit   
and therewithal he laugh d and made cheer  
and told his tale  as ye shall after hear  
 
the tale  
 
a prentice whilom dwelt in our city  
and of a craft of victuallers was he  
galliard he was  as goldfinch in the shaw  
brown as a berry  a proper short fellaw  
with lockes black  combed full fetisly  
and dance he could so well and jollily  
that he was called perkin revellour  
he was as full of love and paramour  
as is the honeycomb of honey sweet  
well was the wenche that with him might meet  
at every bridal would he sing and hop  
he better lov d the tavern than the shop  
for when there any riding was in cheap  
out of the shoppe thither would he leap  
and  till that he had all the sight y seen  
and danced well  he would not come again  
and gather d him a meinie of his sort  
to hop and sing  and make such disport  
and there they sette steven for to meet 
to playen at the dice in such a street  
for in the towne was there no prentice 
that fairer coulde cast a pair of dice 
than perkin could  and thereto he was free 
of his dispence  in place of privity  
that found his master well in his chaffare  
for oftentime he found his box full bare  
for  soothely  a prentice revellour  
that haunteth dice  riot  and paramour  
his master shall it in his shop abie  
all have he no part of the minstrelsy  
for theft and riot they be convertible  
all can they play on gitern or ribible  
revel and truth  as in a low degree  
they be full wroth all day  as men may see  
this jolly prentice with his master bode  
till he was nigh out of his prenticehood  
all were he snubbed both early and late  
and sometimes led with revel to newgate  
but at the last his master him bethought  
upon a day when he his paper sought  
of a proverb  that saith this same word  
better is rotten apple out of hoard  
than that it should rot all the remenant  
so fares it by a riotous servant  
it is well lesse harm to let him pace  
than he shend all the servants in the place  
therefore his master gave him a quittance  
and bade him go  with sorrow and mischance  
and thus this jolly prentice had his leve  
now let him riot all the night  or leave  
and  for there is no thief without a louke  
that helpeth him to wasten and to souk 
of that he bribe can  or borrow may  
anon he sent his bed and his array 
unto a compere of his owen sort  
that loved dice  and riot  and disport  
and had a wife  that held for countenance 
a shop  and swived for her sustenance  
  
the man of law s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
our hoste saw well that the brighte sun 
th  arc of his artificial day had run 
the fourthe part  and half an houre more  
and  though he were not deep expert in lore  
he wist it was the eight and twenty day 
of april  that is messenger to may  
and saw well that the shadow of every tree 
was in its length of the same quantity 
that was the body erect that caused it  
and therefore by the shadow he took his wit  
that phoebus  which that shone so clear and bright  
degrees was five and forty clomb on height  
and for that day  as in that latitude  
it was ten of the clock  he gan conclude  
and suddenly he plight his horse about  
 lordings   quoth he   i warn you all this rout  
the fourthe partie of this day is gone  
now for the love of god and of saint john 
lose no time  as farforth as ye may  
lordings  the time wasteth night and day  
and steals from us  what privily sleeping  
and what through negligence in our waking  
as doth the stream  that turneth never again  
descending from the mountain to the plain  
well might senec  and many a philosopher  
bewaile time more than gold in coffer  
for loss of chattels may recover d be  
but loss of time shendeth us  quoth he  
it will not come again  withoute dread  
no more than will malkin s maidenhead  
when she hath lost it in her wantonness  
let us not moulde thus in idleness  
 sir man of law   quoth he   so have ye bliss  
tell us a tale anon  as forword is  
ye be submitted through your free assent 
to stand in this case at my judgement  
acquit you now  and holde your behest  
then have ye done your devoir at the least   
 hoste   quoth he   de par dieux jeo asente  
to breake forword is not mine intent  
behest is debt  and i would hold it fain  
all my behest  i can no better sayn  
for such law as a man gives another wight  
he should himselfe usen it by right  
thus will our text  but natheless certain 
i can right now no thrifty tale sayn  
but chaucer though he can but lewedly 
on metres and on rhyming craftily 
hath said them  in such english as he can  
of olde time  as knoweth many a man  
and if he have not said them  leve brother  
in one book  he hath said them in another 
for he hath told of lovers up and down  
more than ovide made of mentioun 
in his epistolae  that be full old  
why should i telle them  since they he told  
in youth he made of ceyx and alcyon  
and since then he hath spoke of every one 
these noble wives  and these lovers eke  
whoso that will his large volume seek 
called the saintes  legend of cupid  
there may he see the large woundes wide 
of lucrece  and of babylon thisbe  
the sword of dido for the false enee  
the tree of phillis for her demophon  
the plaint of diane  and of hermion  
of ariadne  and hypsipile  
the barren isle standing in the sea  
the drown d leander for his fair hero  
the teares of helene  and eke the woe 
of briseis  and laodamia  
the cruelty of thee  queen medea  
thy little children hanging by the halse  
for thy jason  that was of love so false  
hypermnestra  penelop   alcest   
your wifehood he commendeth with the best  
but certainly no worde writeth he 
of thilke wick  example of canace  
that loved her own brother sinfully  
of all such cursed stories i say  fy  
or else of tyrius apollonius  
how that the cursed king antiochus 
bereft his daughter of her maidenhead  
that is so horrible a tale to read  
when he her threw upon the pavement  
and therefore he  of full avisement  
would never write in none of his sermons 
of such unkind abominations  
nor i will none rehearse  if that i may  
but of my tale how shall i do this day  
me were loth to be liken d doubteless 
to muses  that men call pierides 
metamorphoseos wot what i mean  
but natheless i recke not a bean  
though i come after him with hawebake  
i speak in prose  and let him rhymes make   
and with that word  he with a sober cheer 
began his tale  and said as ye shall hear  
 
the tale  
 
o scatheful harm  condition of poverty  
with thirst  with cold  with hunger so confounded  
to aske help thee shameth in thine hearte  
if thou none ask  so sore art thou y wounded  
that very need unwrappeth all thy wound hid  
maugre thine head thou must for indigence 
or steal  or beg  or borrow thy dispence  
thou blamest christ  and sayst full bitterly  
he misdeparteth riches temporal  
thy neighebour thou witest sinfully  
and sayst  thou hast too little  and he hath all  
 parfay sayst thou sometime he reckon shall  
when that his tail shall brennen in the glede  
for he not help d the needful in their need   
hearken what is the sentence of the wise  
better to die than to have indigence  
thy selve neighebour will thee despise  
if thou be poor  farewell thy reverence  
yet of the wise man take this sentence  
alle the days of poore men be wick   
beware therefore ere thou come to that prick  
if thou be poor  thy brother hateth thee  
and all thy friendes flee from thee  alas  
o riche merchants  full of wealth be ye  
o noble  prudent folk  as in this case  
your bagges be not fill d with ambes ace  
but with six cinque  that runneth for your chance  
at christenmass well merry may ye dance  
ye seeke land and sea for your winnings  
as wise folk ye knowen all th  estate 
of regnes  ye be fathers of tidings  
and tales  both of peace and of debate  
i were right now of tales desolate  
but that a merchant  gone in many a year  
me taught a tale  which ye shall after hear  
in syria whilom dwelt a company 
of chapmen rich  and thereto sad and true  
clothes of gold  and satins rich of hue  
that widewhere sent their spicery  
their chaffare was so thriftly and so new  
that every wight had dainty to chaffare 
with them  and eke to selle them their ware  
now fell it  that the masters of that sort 
have shapen them to rome for to wend  
were it for chapmanhood or for disport  
none other message would they thither send  
but come themselves to rome  this is the end  
and in such place as thought them a vantage 
for their intent  they took their herbergage  
sojourned have these merchants in that town 
a certain time as fell to their pleasance  
and so befell  that th  excellent renown 
of th  emperore s daughter  dame constance  
reported was  with every circumstance  
unto these syrian merchants in such wise  
from day to day  as i shall you devise 
this was the common voice of every man 
 our emperor of rome  god him see  
a daughter hath  that since the the world began  
to reckon as well her goodness and beauty  
was never such another as is she  
i pray to god in honour her sustene  
and would she were of all europe the queen  
 in her is highe beauty without pride  
and youth withoute greenhood or folly  
to all her workes virtue is her guide  
humbless hath slain in her all tyranny  
she is the mirror of all courtesy  
her heart a very chamber of holiness  
her hand minister of freedom for almess   
and all this voice was sooth  as god is true  
but now to purpose let us turn again  
these merchants have done freight their shippes new  
and when they have this blissful maiden seen  
home to syria then they went full fain  
and did their needes  as they have done yore  
and liv d in weal  i can you say no more  
now fell it  that these merchants stood in grace 
of him that was the soudan of syrie  
for when they came from any strange place 
he would of his benigne courtesy 
make them good cheer  and busily espy 
tidings of sundry regnes  for to lear 
the wonders that they mighte see or hear  
amonges other thinges  specially 
these merchants have him told of dame constance 
so great nobless  in earnest so royally  
that this soudan hath caught so great pleasance 
to have her figure in his remembrance  
that all his lust  and all his busy cure  
was for to love her while his life may dure  
paraventure in thilke large book  
which that men call the heaven  y written was 
with starres  when that he his birthe took  
that he for love should have his death  alas  
for in the starres  clearer than is glass  
is written  god wot  whoso could it read  
the death of every man withoute dread  
in starres many a winter therebeforn 
was writ the death of hector  achilles  
of pompey  julius  ere they were born  
the strife of thebes  and of hercules  
of samson  turnus  and of socrates 
the death  but mennes wittes be so dull  
that no wight can well read it at the full  
this soudan for his privy council sent  
and  shortly of this matter for to pace  
he hath to them declared his intent  
and told them certain  but he might have grace 
to have constance  within a little space  
he was but dead  and charged them in hie 
to shape for his life some remedy  
diverse men diverse thinges said  
and arguments they casten up and down  
many a subtle reason forth they laid  
they speak of magic  and abusion  
but finally  as in conclusion  
they cannot see in that none avantage  
nor in no other way  save marriage  
then saw they therein such difficulty 
by way of reason  for to speak all plain  
because that there was such diversity 
between their bothe lawes  that they sayn  
they trowe that no christian prince would fain 
wedden his child under our lawe sweet  
that us was given by mahound our prophete  
and he answered   rather than i lose 
constance  i will be christen d doubteless 
i must be hers  i may none other choose  
i pray you hold your arguments in peace  
save my life  and be not reckeless 
to gette her that hath my life in cure  
for in this woe i may not long endure   
what needeth greater dilatation  
i say  by treaty and ambassadry  
and by the pope s mediation  
and all the church  and all the chivalry  
that in destruction of mah metry  
and in increase of christe s lawe dear  
they be accorded so as ye may hear  
how that the soudan  and his baronage  
and all his lieges  shall y christen d be  
and he shall have constance in marriage  
and certain gold  i n ot what quantity  
and hereto find they suffisant surety  
the same accord is sworn on either side  
now  fair constance  almighty god thee guide  
now woulde some men waiten  as i guess  
that i should tellen all the purveyance  
the which the emperor of his noblesse 
hath shapen for his daughter  dame constance  
well may men know that so great ordinance 
may no man tellen in a little clause  
as was arrayed for so high a cause  
bishops be shapen with her for to wend  
lordes  ladies  and knightes of renown  
and other folk enough  this is the end  
and notified is throughout all the town  
that every wight with great devotioun 
should pray to christ  that he this marriage 
receive in gree  and speede this voyage  
the day is comen of her departing    
i say the woful fatal day is come  
that there may be no longer tarrying  
but forward they them dressen all and some  
constance  that was with sorrow all o ercome  
full pale arose  and dressed her to wend  
for well she saw there was no other end  
alas  what wonder is it though she wept  
that shall be sent to a strange nation 
from friendes  that so tenderly her kept  
and to be bound under subjection 
of one  she knew not his condition  
husbands be all good  and have been of yore  
that knowe wives  i dare say no more  
 father   she said   thy wretched child constance  
thy younge daughter  foster d up so soft  
and you  my mother  my sov reign pleasance 
over all thing  out taken christ on loft  
constance your child her recommendeth oft 
unto your grace  for i shall to syrie  
nor shall i ever see you more with eye  
 alas  unto the barbarous nation 
i must anon  since that it is your will  
but christ  that starf for our redemption  
so give me grace his hestes to fulfil  
i  wretched woman  no force though i spill  
women are born to thraldom and penance  i perish 
and to be under mannes governance   
i trow at troy when pyrrhus brake the wall  
or ilion burnt  or thebes the city  
nor at rome for the harm through hannibal  
that romans hath y vanquish d times three  
was heard such tender weeping for pity  
as in the chamber was for her parting  
but forth she must  whether she weep or sing  
o firste moving cruel firmament  
with thy diurnal sway that crowdest aye  
and hurtlest all from east till occident 
that naturally would hold another way  
thy crowding set the heav n in such array 
at the beginning of this fierce voyage  
that cruel mars hath slain this marriage  
unfortunate ascendant tortuous  
of which the lord is helpless fall n  alas  
out of his angle into the darkest house  
o mars  o atyzar  as in this case  
o feeble moon  unhappy is thy pace  
thou knittest thee where thou art not receiv d  
where thou wert well  from thennes art thou weiv d  
imprudent emperor of rome  alas  
was there no philosopher in all thy town  
is no time bet than other in such case  
of voyage is there none election  
namely to folk of high condition  
not when a root is of a birth y know  
alas  we be too lewed  or too slow  
to ship was brought this woeful faire maid 
solemnely  with every circumstance  
 now jesus christ be with you all   she said  
there is no more but  farewell  fair constance   
she pained her to make good countenance  
and forth i let her sail in this manner  
and turn i will again to my matter  
the mother of the soudan  well of vices  
espied hath her sone s plain intent  
how he will leave his olde sacrifices  
and right anon she for her council sent  
and they be come  to knowe what she meant  
and when assembled was this folk in fere  
she sat her down  and said as ye shall hear  
 lordes   she said   ye knowen every one  
how that my son in point is for to lete 
the holy lawes of our alkaron  
given by god s messenger mahomete  
but one avow to greate god i hete  
life shall rather out of my body start  
than mahomet s law go out of mine heart  
 what should us tiden of this newe law  
but thraldom to our bodies  and penance  
and afterward in hell to be y draw  
for we renied mahound our creance  
but  lordes  will ye maken assurance  
as i shall say  assenting to my lore  
and i shall make us safe for evermore   
they sworen and assented every man 
to live with her and die  and by her stand  
and every one  in the best wise he can  
to strengthen her shall all his friendes fand  
and she hath this emprise taken in hand  
which ye shall heare that i shall devise  
and to them all she spake right in this wise  
 we shall first feign us christendom to take  
cold water shall not grieve us but a lite  
and i shall such a feast and revel make  
that  as i trow  i shall the soudan quite  
for though his wife be christen d ne er so white  
she shall have need to wash away the red  
though she a fount of water with her led   
o soudaness  root of iniquity  
virago thou  semiramis the second  
o serpent under femininity  
like to the serpent deep in hell y bound  
o feigned woman  all that may confound 
virtue and innocence  through thy malice  
is bred in thee  as nest of every vice  
o satan envious  since thilke day 
that thou wert chased from our heritage  
well knowest thou to woman th  olde way  
thou madest eve to bring us in servage  
thou wilt fordo this christian marriage  
thine instrument so well away the while  
mak st thou of women when thou wilt beguile  
this soudaness  whom i thus blame and warray  
let privily her council go their way  
why should i in this tale longer tarry  
she rode unto the soudan on a day  
and said him  that she would reny her lay  
and christendom of priestes  handes fong  
repenting her she heathen was so long  
beseeching him to do her that honour  
that she might have the christian folk to feast  
 to please them i will do my labour   
the soudan said   i will do at your hest   
and kneeling  thanked her for that request  
so glad he was  he wist not what to say  
she kiss d her son  and home she went her way  
arrived be these christian folk to land 
in syria  with a great solemne rout  
and hastily this soudan sent his sond  
first to his mother  and all the realm about  
and said  his wife was comen out of doubt  
and pray d them for to ride again the queen  
the honour of his regne to sustene  
great was the press  and rich was the array 
of syrians and romans met in fere  
the mother of the soudan rich and gay 
received her with all so glad a cheer 
as any mother might her daughter dear 
and to the nexte city there beside 
a softe pace solemnely they ride  
nought  trow i  the triumph of julius 
of which that lucan maketh such a boast  
was royaller  or more curious  
than was th  assembly of this blissful host 
but o this scorpion  this wicked ghost  
the soudaness  for all her flattering 
cast under this full mortally to sting  
the soudan came himself soon after this  
so royally  that wonder is to tell  
and welcomed her with all joy and bliss  
and thus in mirth and joy i let them dwell  
the fruit of his matter is that i tell  
when the time came  men thought it for the best 
that revel stint  and men go to their rest  
the time is come that this old soudaness 
ordained hath the feast of which i told  
and to the feast the christian folk them dress 
in general  yea  bothe young and old  
there may men feast and royalty behold  
and dainties more than i can you devise  
but all too dear they bought it ere they rise  
o sudden woe  that ev r art successour 
to worldly bliss  sprent is with bitterness 
th  end of our joy  of our worldly labour  
woe occupies the fine of our gladness  
hearken this counsel  for thy sickerness  
upon thy glade days have in thy mind 
the unware woe of harm  that comes behind  
for  shortly for to tell it at a word  
the soudan and the christians every one 
were all to hewn and sticked at the board  
but it were only dame constance alone  
this olde soudaness  this cursed crone  
had with her friendes done this cursed deed  
for she herself would all the country lead  
nor there was syrian that was converted  
that of the counsel of the soudan wot  
that was not all to hewn  ere he asterted  
and constance have they ta en anon foot hot  
and in a ship all  god wot  
they have her set  and bid her learn to sail 
out of syria again ward to itale  
a certain treasure that she thither lad  
and  sooth to say  of victual great plenty  
they have her giv n  and clothes eke she had 
and forth she sailed in the salte sea  
o my constance  full of benignity  
o emperores younge daughter dear  
he that is lord of fortune be thy steer  
she bless d herself  and with full piteous voice 
unto the cross of christ thus saide she  
 o dear  o wealful altar  holy cross  
red of the lambes blood  full of pity  
that wash d the world from old iniquity  
me from the fiend and from his clawes keep  
that day that i shall drenchen in the deepe  
 victorious tree  protection of the true  
that only worthy were for to bear 
the king of heaven  with his woundes new  
the white lamb  that hurt was with a spear  
flemer of fiendes out of him and her 
on which thy limbes faithfully extend  
me keep  and give me might my life to mend   
yeares and days floated this creature 
throughout the sea of greece  unto the strait 
of maroc  as it was her a venture  
on many a sorry meal now may she bait  
after her death full often may she wait  
ere that the wilde waves will her drive 
unto the place there as she shall arrive  
men mighten aske  why she was not slain  
eke at the feast who might her body save  
and i answer to that demand again  
who saved daniel in the horrible cave  
where every wight  save he  master or knave  
was with the lion frett  ere he astart  
no wight but god  that he bare in his heart  
god list to shew his wonderful miracle 
in her  that we should see his mighty workes  
christ  which that is to every harm triacle  
by certain meanes oft  as knowe clerkes  
doth thing for certain ende  that full derk is 
to manne s wit  that for our  ignorance 
ne cannot know his prudent purveyance  
now since she was not at the feast y slaw  
who kepte her from drowning in the sea  
who kepte jonas in the fish s maw  
till he was spouted up at nineveh  
well may men know  it was no wight but he 
that kept the hebrew people from drowning  
with drye feet throughout the sea passing  
who bade the foure spirits of tempest  
that power have t  annoye land and sea  
both north and south  and also west and east  
annoye neither sea  nor land  nor tree  
soothly the commander of that was he 
that from the tempest aye this woman kept  
as well when she awoke as when she slept  
where might this woman meat and drinke have  
three year and more how lasted her vitaille  
who fed the egyptian mary in the cave 
or in desert  no wight but christ sans faille  
five thousand folk it was as great marvaille 
with loaves five and fishes two to feed 
god sent his foison at her greate need  
she drived forth into our ocean 
throughout our wilde sea  till at the last 
under an hold  that nempnen i not can  
far in northumberland  the wave her cast 
and in the sand her ship sticked so fast 
that thennes would it not in all a tide  
the will of christ was that she should abide  
the constable of the castle down did fare 
to see this wreck  and all the ship he sought  
and found this weary woman full of care  
he found also the treasure that she brought  
in her language mercy she besought  
the life out of her body for to twin  
her to deliver of woe that she was in  
a manner latin corrupt was her speech  
but algate thereby was she understond  
the constable  when him list no longer seech  
this woeful woman brought he to the lond  
she kneeled down  and thanked godde s sond  
but what she was she would to no man say 
for foul nor fair  although that she should dey  
she said  she was so mazed in the sea  
that she forgot her minde  by her truth  
the constable had of her so great pity 
and eke his wife  that they wept for ruth  
she was so diligent withoute slouth 
to serve and please every one in that place  
that all her lov d  that looked in her face  
the constable and dame hermegild his wife 
were pagans  and that country every where  
but hermegild lov d constance as her life  
and constance had so long sojourned there 
in orisons  with many a bitter tear  
till jesus had converted through his grace 
dame hermegild  constabless of that place  
in all that land no christians durste rout  
all christian folk had fled from that country 
through pagans  that conquered all about 
the plages of the north by land and sea  
to wales had fled the 
of olde britons  dwelling in this isle  were christians 
there was their refuge for the meanewhile  
but yet n ere christian britons so exiled  
that there n ere some which in their privity not 
honoured christ  and heathen folk beguiled  
and nigh the castle such there dwelled three  
and one of them was blind  and might not see  
but it were with thilk eyen of his mind  
with which men maye see when they be blind  
bright was the sun  as in a summer s day  
for which the constable  and his wife also  
and constance  have y take the righte way 
toward the sea a furlong way or two  
to playen  and to roame to and fro  
and in their walk this blinde man they met  
crooked and old  with eyen fast y shet  
 in the name of christ   cried this blind briton  
 dame hermegild  give me my sight again   
this lady wax d afrayed of that soun   
lest that her husband  shortly for to sayn  
would her for jesus christe s love have slain  
till constance made her hold  and bade her wirch 
the will of christ  as daughter of holy church 
the constable wax d abashed of that sight  
and saide   what amounteth all this fare   
constance answered   sir  it is christ s might  this ado  
that helpeth folk out of the fiendes snare   
and so farforth she gan our law declare  
that she the constable  ere that it were eve  
converted  and on christ made him believe  
this constable was not lord of the place 
of which i speak  there as he constance fand  
but kept it strongly many a winter space  
under alla  king of northumberland  
that was full wise  and worthy of his hand 
against the scotes  as men may well hear  
but turn i will again to my mattere  
satan  that ever us waiteth to beguile  
saw of constance all her perfectioun  
and cast anon how he might quite her while  
and made a young knight  that dwelt in that town  revenge on her 
love her so hot of foul affectioun  
that verily him thought that he should spill 
but he of her might ones have his will  
he wooed her  but it availed nought  
she woulde do no sinne by no way  
and for despite  he compassed his thought 
to make her a shameful death to dey  
he waiteth when the constable is away  
and privily upon a night he crept 
in hermegilda s chamber while she slept  
weary  forwaked in her orisons  
sleepeth constance  and hermegild also  
this knight  through satanas  temptation  
all softetly is to the bed y go  
and cut the throat of hermegild in two  
and laid the bloody knife by dame constance  
and went his way  there god give him mischance  
soon after came the constable home again  
and eke alla that king was of that land  
and saw his wife dispiteously slain  
for which full oft he wept and wrung his hand  
and ill the bed the bloody knife he fand 
by dame constance  alas  what might she say  
for very woe her wit was all away  
to king alla was told all this mischance 
and eke the time  and where  and in what wise 
that in a ship was founden this constance  
as here before ye have me heard devise  
the kinges heart for pity gan agrise  
when he saw so benign a creature 
fall in disease and in misaventure  
for as the lamb toward his death is brought  
so stood this innocent before the king  
this false knight  that had this treason wrought  
bore her in hand that she had done this thing  
but natheless there was great murmuring 
among the people  that say they cannot guess 
that she had done so great a wickedness  
for they had seen her ever virtuous  
and loving hermegild right as her life  
of this bare witness each one in that house  
save he that hermegild slew with his knife  
this gentle king had caught a great motife 
of this witness  and thought he would inquere by the evidence 
deeper into this case  the truth to lear  
alas  constance  thou has no champion  
nor fighte canst thou not  so well away  
but he that starf for our redemption  
and bound satan  and yet li th where he lay  
so be thy stronge champion this day  
for  but christ upon thee miracle kithe  
withoute guilt thou shalt be slain as swithe  
she set her down on knees  and thus she said  
 immortal god  that savedest susanne 
from false blame  and thou merciful maid  
mary i mean  the daughter to saint anne  
before whose child the angels sing osanne  
if i be guiltless of this felony  
my succour be  or elles shall i die   
have ye not seen sometime a pale face 
among a press of him that hath been lad 
toward his death  where he getteth no grace  
and such a colour in his face hath had  
men mighte know him that was so bestad 
amonges all the faces in that rout  
so stood constance  and looked her about  
o queenes living in prosperity  
duchesses  and ye ladies every one  
have some ruth on her adversity  
an emperor s daughter  she stood alone  
she had no wight to whom to make her moan  
o blood royal  that standest in this drede  
far be thy friendes in thy greate need  
this king alla had such compassioun  
as gentle heart is full filled of pity  
that from his eyen ran the water down 
 now hastily do fetch a book   quoth he  
 and if this knight will sweare  how that she 
this woman slew  yet will we us advise 
whom that we will that shall be our justice   
a briton book  written with evangiles  
was fetched  and on this book he swore anon 
she guilty was  and  in the meanewhiles  
an hand him smote upon the necke bone  
that down he fell at once right as a stone  
and both his eyen burst out of his face 
in sight of ev rybody in that place  
a voice was heard  in general audience  
that said   thou hast deslander d guilteless 
the daughter of holy church in high presence  
thus hast thou done  and yet hold i my peace   
of this marvel aghast was all the press  
as mazed folk they stood every one 
for dread of wreake  save constance alone  
great was the dread and eke the repentance 
of them that hadde wrong suspicion 
upon this sely innocent constance  
and for this miracle  in conclusion  
and by constance s mediation  
the king  and many another in that place  
converted was  thanked be christe s grace  
this false knight was slain for his untruth 
by judgement of alla hastily  
and yet constance had of his death great ruth  
and after this jesus of his mercy 
made alla wedde full solemnely 
this holy woman  that is so bright and sheen  
and thus hath christ y made constance a queen  
but who was woeful  if i shall not lie  
of this wedding but donegild  and no mo   
the kinge s mother  full of tyranny  
her thought her cursed heart would burst in two  
she would not that her son had done so  
her thought it a despite that he should take 
so strange a creature unto his make  
me list not of the chaff nor of the stre 
make so long a tale  as of the corn  
what should i tellen of the royalty 
of this marriage  or which course goes beforn  
who bloweth in a trump or in an horn  
the fruit of every tale is for to say  
they eat and drink  and dance  and sing  and play  
they go to bed  as it was skill and right  
for though that wives be full holy things  
they muste take in patience at night 
such manner necessaries as be pleasings 
to folk that have y wedded them with rings  
and lay a lite their holiness aside 
as for the time  it may no better betide  
on her he got a knave child anon  
and to a bishop and to his constable eke 
he took his wife to keep  when he is gone 
to scotland ward  his foemen for to seek  
now fair constance  that is so humble and meek  
so long is gone with childe till that still 
she held her chamb r  abiding christe s will 
the time is come  a knave child she bare  
mauricius at the font stone they him call  
this constable doth forth come a messenger  
and wrote unto his king that clep d was all   
how that this blissful tiding is befall  
and other tidings speedful for to say 
he hath the letter  and forth he go th his way  
this messenger  to do his avantage  
unto the kinge s mother rideth swithe  
and saluteth her full fair in his language  
 madame   quoth he   ye may be glad and blithe  
and thanke god an hundred thousand sithe  
my lady queen hath child  withoute doubt  
to joy and bliss of all this realm about  
 lo  here the letter sealed of this thing  
that i must bear with all the haste i may  
if ye will aught unto your son the king  
i am your servant both by night and day   
donegild answer d   as now at this time  nay  
but here i will all night thou take thy rest  
to morrow will i say thee what me lest   
this messenger drank sadly ale and wine  
and stolen were his letters privily 
out of his box  while he slept as a swine  
and counterfeited was full subtilly 
another letter  wrote full sinfully  
unto the king  direct of this mattere 
from his constable  as ye shall after hear  
this letter said  the queen deliver d was 
of so horrible a fiendlike creature  
that in the castle none so hardy was 
that any while he durst therein endure  
the mother was an elf by aventure 
become  by charmes or by sorcery  
and every man hated her company  
woe was this king when he this letter had seen  
but to no wight he told his sorrows sore  
but with his owen hand he wrote again  
 welcome the sond of christ for evermore 
to me  that am now learned in this lore  
lord  welcome be thy lust and thy pleasance  
my lust i put all in thine ordinance  
 keepe this child  albeit foul or fair  
and eke my wife  unto mine homecoming  
christ when him list may send to me an heir 
more agreeable than this to my liking   
this letter he sealed  privily weeping  
which to the messenger was taken soon  
and forth he went  there is no more to do n  
o messenger full fill d of drunkenness  
strong is thy breath  thy limbes falter aye  
and thou betrayest alle secretness  
thy mind is lorn  thou janglest as a jay  
thy face is turned in a new array  
where drunkenness reigneth in any rout  
there is no counsel hid  withoute doubt  
o donegild  i have no english dign 
unto thy malice  and thy tyranny  
and therefore to the fiend i thee resign  
let him indite of all thy treachery 
 fy  mannish  fy  o nay  by god i lie  
fy  fiendlike spirit  for i dare well tell  
though thou here walk  thy spirit is in hell  
this messenger came from the king again  
and at the kinge s mother s court he light  
and she was of this messenger full fain  
and pleased him in all that e er she might  
he drank  and well his girdle underpight  
he slept  and eke he snored in his guise under his girdle 
all night  until the sun began to rise  
eft were his letters stolen every one  
and counterfeited letters in this wise  
the king commanded his constable anon  
on pain of hanging and of high jewise  
that he should suffer in no manner wise 
constance within his regne for to abide 
three dayes  and a quarter of a tide  
but in the same ship as he her fand  
her and her younge son  and all her gear  
he shoulde put  and crowd her from the land  
and charge her  that she never eft come there  
o my constance  well may thy ghost have fear  
and sleeping in thy dream be in penance  
when donegild cast all this ordinance  
this messenger  on morrow when he woke  
unto the castle held the nexte way  
and to the constable the letter took  
and when he this dispiteous letter sey  
full oft he said   alas  and well away  
lord christ   quoth he   how may this world endure  
so full of sin is many a creature  
 o mighty god  if that it be thy will  
since thou art rightful judge  how may it be 
that thou wilt suffer innocence to spill  
and wicked folk reign in prosperity  
ah  good constance  alas  so woe is me  
that i must be thy tormentor  or dey 
a shameful death  there is no other way  
wept bothe young and old in all that place  
when that the king this cursed letter sent  
and constance  with a deadly pale face  
the fourthe day toward her ship she went  
but natheless she took in good intent 
the will of christ  and kneeling on the strond 
she saide   lord  aye welcome be thy sond 
 he that me kepte from the false blame  
while i was in the land amonges you  
he can me keep from harm and eke from shame 
in the salt sea  although i see not how 
as strong as ever he was  he is yet now  
in him trust i  and in his mother dere  
that is to me my sail and eke my stere   
her little child lay weeping in her arm 
and  kneeling  piteously to him she said 
 peace  little son  i will do thee no harm   
with that her kerchief off her head she braid  
and over his little eyen she it laid  
and in her arm she lulled it full fast  
and unto heav n her eyen up she cast  
 mother   quoth she   and maiden bright  mary  
sooth is  that through a woman s eggement 
mankind was lorn  and damned aye to die  
for which thy child was on a cross y rent  
thy blissful eyen saw all his torment  
then is there no comparison between 
thy woe  and any woe man may sustene  
 thou saw st thy child y slain before thine eyen  
and yet now lives my little child  parfay  
now  lady bright  to whom the woeful cryen  
thou glory of womanhood  thou faire may  
thou haven of refuge  bright star of day  
rue on my child  that of thy gentleness 
ruest on every rueful in distress  
 o little child  alas  what is thy guilt  
that never wroughtest sin as yet  pardie  
why will thine harde father have thee spilt  
o mercy  deare constable   quoth she  
 and let my little child here dwell with thee  
and if thou dar st not save him from blame  
so kiss him ones in his father s name   
therewith she looked backward to the land  
and saide   farewell  husband rutheless   
and up she rose  and walked down the strand 
toward the ship  her following all the press  
and ever she pray d her child to hold his peace  
and took her leave  and with an holy intent 
she blessed her  and to the ship she went  
victualed was the ship  it is no drede  
abundantly for her a full long space  
and other necessaries that should need 
she had enough  heried be godde s grace  
for wind and weather  almighty god purchase  
and bring her home  i can no better say  
but in the sea she drived forth her way  
alla the king came home soon after this 
unto the castle  of the which i told  
and asked where his wife and his child is  
the constable gan about his heart feel cold  
and plainly all the matter he him told 
as ye have heard  i can tell it no better  
and shew d the king his seal  and eke his letter 
and saide   lord  as ye commanded me 
on pain of death  so have i done certain   
the messenger tormented was  till he 
muste beknow  and tell it flat and plain  
from night to night in what place he had lain  
and thus  by wit and subtle inquiring  
imagin d was by whom this harm gan spring  
the hand was known that had the letter wrote  
and all the venom of the cursed deed  
but in what wise  certainly i know not  
th  effect is this  that alla  out of drede  
his mother slew  that may men plainly read  
for that she traitor was to her liegeance  
thus ended olde donegild with mischance  
the sorrow that this alla night and day 
made for his wife  and for his child also  
there is no tongue that it telle may  
but now will i again to constance go  
that floated in the sea in pain and woe 
five year and more  as liked christe s sond  
ere that her ship approached to the lond  
under an heathen castle  at the last  
of which the name in my text i not find  
constance and eke her child the sea upcast  
almighty god  that saved all mankind  
have on constance and on her child some mind  
that fallen is in heathen hand eftsoon 
in point to spill  as i shall tell you soon  
down from the castle came there many a wight 
to gauren on this ship  and on constance  
but shortly from the castle  on a night  
the lorde s steward    god give him mischance    
a thief that had renied our creance  
came to the ship alone  and said he would 
her leman be  whether she would or n ould  
woe was this wretched woman then begone  
her child cri d  and she cried piteously  
but blissful mary help d her right anon  
for  with her struggling well and mightily  
the thief fell overboard all suddenly  
and in the sea he drenched for vengeance  
and thus hath christ unwemmed kept constance  
o foul lust of luxury  lo thine end  
not only that thou faintest manne s mind  
but verily thou wilt his body shend  
th  end of thy work  or of thy lustes blind  
is complaining  how many may men find  
that not for work  sometimes  but for th  intent 
to do this sin  be either slain or shent  
how may this weake woman have the strength 
her to defend against this renegate  
o goliath  unmeasurable of length  
how mighte david make thee so mate  
so young  and of armour so desolate  
how durst he look upon thy dreadful face  
well may men see it was but godde s grace  
who gave judith courage or hardiness 
to slay him  holofernes  in his tent  
and to deliver out of wretchedness 
the people of god  i say for this intent 
that right as god spirit of vigour sent 
to them  and saved them out of mischance  
so sent he might and vigour to constance  
forth went her ship throughout the narrow mouth 
of jubaltare and septe  driving alway  
sometime west  and sometime north and south  
and sometime east  full many a weary day  
till christe s mother blessed be she aye 
had shaped through her endeless goodness 
to make an end of all her heaviness  
now let us stint of constance but a throw  
and speak we of the roman emperor  
that out of syria had by letters know 
the slaughter of christian folk  and dishonor 
done to his daughter by a false traitor  
i mean the cursed wicked soudaness  
that at the feast let slay both more and less  
 
for which this emperor had sent anon 
his senator  with royal ordinance  
and other lordes  god wot  many a one  
on syrians to take high vengeance  
they burn and slay  and bring them to mischance 
full many a day  but shortly this is th  end  
homeward to rome they shaped them to wend  
this senator repaired with victory 
to rome ward  sailing full royally  
and met the ship driving  as saith the story  
in which constance sat full piteously  
and nothing knew he what she was  nor why 
she was in such array  nor she will say 
of her estate  although that she should dey  
he brought her unto rome  and to his wife 
he gave her  and her younge son also  
and with the senator she led her life  
thus can our lady bringen out of woe 
woeful constance  and many another mo   
and longe time she dwelled in that place  
in holy works ever  as was her grace  
the senatores wife her aunte was  
but for all that she knew her ne er the more  
i will no longer tarry in this case  
but to king alla  whom i spake of yore  
that for his wife wept and sighed sore  
i will return  and leave i will constance 
under the senatores governance  
king alla  which that had his mother slain  
upon a day fell in such repentance  
that  if i shortly tell it shall and plain  
to rome he came to receive his penitance  
and put him in the pope s ordinance 
in high and low  and jesus christ besought 
forgive his wicked works that he had wrought  
the fame anon throughout the town is borne  
how alla king shall come on pilgrimage  
by harbingers that wente him beforn  
for which the senator  as was usage  
rode him again  and many of his lineage  
as well to show his high magnificence  
as to do any king a reverence  
great cheere did this noble senator 
to king alla and he to him also  
each of them did the other great honor  
and so befell  that in a day or two 
this senator did to king alla go 
to feast  and shortly  if i shall not lie  
constance s son went in his company  
some men would say  at request of constance 
this senator had led this child to feast  
i may not tellen every circumstance  
be as be may  there was he at the least  
but sooth is this  that at his mother s hest 
before alla during the meates space  
the child stood  looking in the kinges face  
this alla king had of this child great wonder  
and to the senator he said anon  
 whose is that faire child that standeth yonder   
 i n ot   quoth he   by god and by saint john  
a mother he hath  but father hath he none  
that i of wot   and shortly in a stound 
he told to alla how this child was found  
 but god wot   quoth this senator also  
 so virtuous a liver in all my life 
i never saw  as she  nor heard of mo  
of worldly woman  maiden  widow or wife  
i dare well say she hadde lever a knife 
throughout her breast  than be a woman wick   
there is no man could bring her to that prick  
now was this child as like unto constance 
as possible is a creature to be  
this alla had the face in remembrance 
of dame constance  and thereon mused he  
if that the childe s mother were aught she 
that was his wife  and privily he sight  
and sped him from the table he might  
 parfay   thought he   phantom is in mine head  
i ought to deem  of skilful judgement  
that in the salte sea my wife is dead   
and afterward he made his argument  
 what wot i  if that christ have hither sent 
my wife by sea  as well as he her sent 
to my country  from thennes that she went   
and  after noon  home with the senator  
went alla  for to see this wondrous chance  
this senator did alla great honor  
and hastily he sent after constance  
but truste well  her liste not to dance  
when that she wiste wherefore was that sond  
unneth upon her feet she mighte stand  
when alla saw his wife  fair he her gret  
and wept  that it was ruthe for to see  
for at the firste look he on her set 
he knew well verily that it was she  
and she  for sorrow  as dumb stood as a tree  
so was her hearte shut in her distress  
when she remember d his unkindeness  
twice she swooned in his owen sight  
he wept and him excused piteously  
 now god   quoth he   and all his hallows bright 
so wisly on my soule have mercy  
that of your harm as guilteless am i  
as is maurice my son  so like your face  
else may the fiend me fetch out of this place   
long was the sobbing and the bitter pain  
ere that their woeful heartes mighte cease  
great was the pity for to hear them plain  
through whiche plaintes gan their woe increase  
i pray you all my labour to release  
i may not tell all their woe till to morrow  
i am so weary for to speak of sorrow  
but finally  when that the sooth is wist  
that alla guiltless was of all her woe  
i trow an hundred times have they kiss d  
and such a bliss is there betwixt them two  
that  save the joy that lasteth evermo   
there is none like  that any creature 
hath seen  or shall see  while the world may dure  
then prayed she her husband meekely 
in the relief of her long piteous pine  
that he would pray her father specially  
that of his majesty he would incline 
to vouchesafe some day with him to dine  
she pray d him eke  that he should by no way 
unto her father no word of her say  
some men would say  how that the child maurice 
did this message unto the emperor  
but  as i guess  alla was not so nice  
to him that is so sovereign of honor 
as he that is of christian folk the flow r  
send any child  but better  tis to deem 
he went himself  and so it may well seem  
this emperor hath granted gentilly 
to come to dinner  as he him besought  
and well rede i  he looked busily 
upon this child  and on his daughter thought  
alla went to his inn  and as him ought 
arrayed for this feast in every wise  
as farforth as his cunning may suffice  
the morrow came  and alla gan him dress  
and eke his wife  the emperor to meet  
and forth they rode in joy and in gladness  
and when she saw her father in the street  
she lighted down and fell before his feet  
 father   quoth she   your younge child constance 
is now full clean out of your remembrance  
 i am your daughter  your constance   quoth she  
 that whilom ye have sent into syrie  
it am i  father  that in the salt sea 
was put alone  and damned for to die  
now  goode father  i you mercy cry  
send me no more into none heatheness  
but thank my lord here of his kindeness   
who can the piteous joye tellen all  
betwixt them three  since they be thus y met  
but of my tale make an end i shall  
the day goes fast  i will no longer let  
these gladde folk to dinner be y set  
in joy and bliss at meat i let them dwell  
a thousand fold well more than i can tell  
this child maurice was since then emperor 
made by the pope  and lived christianly  
to christe s churche did he great honor  
but i let all his story passe by  
of constance is my tale especially  
in the olde roman gestes men may find 
maurice s life  i bear it not in mind  
this king alla  when he his time sey  
with his constance  his holy wife so sweet  
to england are they come the righte way  
where they did live in joy and in quiet  
but little while it lasted  i you hete  
joy of this world for time will not abide  
from day to night it changeth as the tide  
who liv d ever in such delight one day  
that him not moved either conscience  
or ire  or talent  or some kind affray  
envy  or pride  or passion  or offence  
i say but for this ende this sentence  
that little while in joy or in pleasance 
lasted the bliss of alla with constance  
for death  that takes of high and low his rent  
when passed was a year  even as i guess  
out of this world this king alla he hent  
for whom constance had full great heaviness  
now let us pray that god his soule bless  
and dame constance  finally to say  
toward the town of rome went her way  
to rome is come this holy creature  
and findeth there her friendes whole and sound  
now is she scaped all her aventure  
and when that she her father hath y found  
down on her knees falleth she to ground  
weeping for tenderness in hearte blithe 
she herieth god an hundred thousand sithe  
in virtue and in holy almes deed 
they liven all  and ne er asunder wend  
till death departeth them  this life they lead  
and fare now well  my tale is at an end 
now jesus christ  that of his might may send 
joy after woe  govern us in his grace 
and keep us alle that be in this place  
 
the wife of bath s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
experience  though none authority 
were in this world  is right enough for me 
to speak of woe that is in marriage  
for  lordings  since i twelve year was of age  
thanked be god that is etern on live  
husbands at the church door have i had five  
for i so often have y wedded be  
and all were worthy men in their degree  
but me was told  not longe time gone is 
that sithen christe went never but ones 
to wedding  in the cane of galilee  
that by that ilk example taught he me  
that i not wedded shoulde be but once  
lo  hearken eke a sharp word for the nonce  
beside a welle jesus  god and man  
spake in reproof of the samaritan  
 thou hast y had five husbandes   said he  
 and thilke man  that now hath wedded thee  
is not thine husband   thus said he certain  
what that he meant thereby  i cannot sayn  
but that i aske  why the fifthe man 
was not husband to the samaritan  
how many might she have in marriage  
yet heard i never tellen in mine age 
upon this number definitioun  
men may divine  and glosen up and down  
but well i wot  express without a lie  
god bade us for to wax and multiply  
that gentle text can i well understand  
eke well i wot  he said  that mine husband 
should leave father and mother  and take to me  
but of no number mention made he  
of bigamy or of octogamy  
why then should men speak of it villainy  
lo here  the wise king dan solomon  
i trow that he had wives more than one  
as would to god it lawful were to me 
to be refreshed half so oft as he  
what gift of god had he for all his wives  
no man hath such  that in this world alive is  
god wot  this noble king  as to my wit  
the first night had many a merry fit 
with each of them  so well was him on live  
blessed be god that i have wedded five  
welcome the sixth whenever that he shall  
for since i will not keep me chaste in all  
when mine husband is from the world y gone  
some christian man shall wedde me anon  
for then th  apostle saith that i am free 
to wed  a  god s half  where it liketh me  
he saith  that to be wedded is no sin  
better is to be wedded than to brin  
what recketh me though folk say villainy 
of shrewed lamech  and his bigamy  
i wot well abraham was a holy man  
and jacob eke  as far as ev r i can 
and each of them had wives more than two  
and many another holy man also  
where can ye see  in any manner age  
that highe god defended marriage 
by word express  i pray you tell it me  
or where commanded he virginity  
i wot as well as you  it is no dread  
th  apostle  when he spake of maidenhead  
he said  that precept thereof had he none  
men may counsel a woman to be one  
but counseling is no commandement  
he put it in our owen judgement  
for  hadde god commanded maidenhead  
then had he damned wedding out of dread  
and certes  if there were no seed y sow  
virginity then whereof should it grow  
paul durste not commanden  at the least  
a thing of which his master gave no hest  
the dart is set up for virginity  al 
catch whoso may  who runneth best let see  
but this word is not ta en of every wight  
but there as god will give it of his might  
i wot well that th  apostle was a maid  
but natheless  although he wrote and said  
he would that every wight were such as he  
all is but counsel to virginity  
and  since to be a wife he gave me leave 
of indulgence  so is it no repreve 
to wedde me  if that my make should die  
without exception of bigamy  
all were it good no woman for to touch 
he meant as in his bed or in his couch  
for peril is both fire and tow t assemble 
ye know what this example may resemble  
this is all and some  he held virginity 
more profit than wedding in frailty  
frailty clepe i  but if that he and she 
would lead their lives all in chastity  unless 
i grant it well  i have of none envy 
who maidenhead prefer to bigamy  
it liketh them t  be clean in body and ghost  
of mine estate i will not make a boast  
for  well ye know  a lord in his household 
hath not every vessel all of gold  
some are of tree  and do their lord service  
god calleth folk to him in sundry wise  
and each one hath of god a proper gift  
some this  some that  as liketh him to shift  
virginity is great perfection  
and continence eke with devotion  
but christ  that of perfection is the well  
bade not every wight he should go sell 
all that he had  and give it to the poor  
and in such wise follow him and his lore  
he spake to them that would live perfectly    
and  lordings  by your leave  that am not i  
i will bestow the flower of mine age 
in th  acts and in the fruits of marriage  
tell me also  to what conclusion 
were members made of generation  
and of so perfect wise a wight y wrought  
trust me right well  they were not made for nought  
glose whoso will  and say both up and down  
that they were made for the purgatioun 
of urine  and of other thinges smale  
and eke to know a female from a male  
and for none other cause  say ye no  
experience wot well it is not so  
so that the clerkes be not with me wroth  
i say this  that they were made for both  
that is to say  for office  and for ease 
of engendrure  there we god not displease  
why should men elles in their bookes set  
that man shall yield unto his wife her debt  
now wherewith should he make his payement  
if he us d not his silly instrument  
then were they made upon a creature 
to purge urine  and eke for engendrure  
but i say not that every wight is hold  
that hath such harness as i to you told  
to go and use them in engendrure  
then should men take of chastity no cure  
christ was a maid  and shapen as a man  
and many a saint  since that this world began  
yet ever liv d in perfect chastity  
i will not vie with no virginity  
let them with bread of pured wheat be fed  
and let us wives eat our barley bread  
and yet with barley bread  mark tell us can  
our lord jesus refreshed many a man  
in such estate as god hath cleped us  
i ll persevere  i am not precious  over dainty 
in wifehood i will use mine instrument 
as freely as my maker hath it sent  
if i be dangerous god give me sorrow  
mine husband shall it have  both eve and morrow  
when that him list come forth and pay his debt  
a husband will i have  i no let  
which shall be both my debtor and my thrall  
and have his tribulation withal 
upon his flesh  while that i am his wife  
i have the power during all my life 
upon his proper body  and not he  
right thus th  apostle told it unto me  
and bade our husbands for to love us well  
all this sentence me liketh every deal  
up start the pardoner  and that anon  
 now  dame   quoth he   by god and by saint john  
ye are a noble preacher in this case  
i was about to wed a wife  alas  
what  should i bie it on my flesh so dear  
yet had i lever wed no wife this year   
 abide   quoth she   my tale is not begun 
nay  thou shalt drinken of another tun 
ere that i go  shall savour worse than ale  
and when that i have told thee forth my tale 
of tribulation in marriage  
of which i am expert in all mine age  
this is to say  myself hath been the whip  
then mayest thou choose whether thou wilt sip 
of thilke tunne  that i now shall broach  
beware of it  ere thou too nigh approach  
for i shall tell examples more than ten  
whoso will not beware by other men  
by him shall other men corrected be  
these same wordes writeth ptolemy  
read in his almagest  and take it there   
 dame  i would pray you  if your will it were   
saide this pardoner   as ye began  
tell forth your tale  and spare for no man  
and teach us younge men of your practique   
 gladly   quoth she   since that it may you like  
but that i pray to all this company  
if that i speak after my fantasy  
to take nought agrief what i may say  
for mine intent is only for to play  
now  sirs  then will i tell you forth my tale  
as ever may i drinke wine or ale 
i shall say sooth  the husbands that i had 
three of them were good  and two were bad 
the three were goode men  and rich  and old 
unnethes mighte they the statute hold 
in which that they were bounden unto me  
yet wot well what i mean of this  pardie  
as god me help  i laugh when that i think 
how piteously at night i made them swink  
but  by my fay  i told of it no store  
they had me giv n their land and their treasor 
me needed not do longer diligence 
to win their love  or do them reverence  
they loved me so well  by god above  
that i tolde no dainty of their love 
a wise woman will busy her ever in one 
to get their love  where that she hath none  
but  since i had them wholly in my hand  
and that they had me given all their land  
why should i take keep them for to please  
but it were for my profit  or mine ease  
i set them so a worke  by my fay  
that many a night they sange  well away  
the bacon was not fetched for them  i trow  
that some men have in essex at dunmow  
i govern d them so well after my law  
that each of them full blissful was and fawe 
to bringe me gay thinges from the fair  
they were full glad when that i spake them fair  
for  god it wot  i chid them spiteously  
now hearken how i bare me properly  
ye wise wives  that can understand  
thus should ye speak  and bear them wrong on hand  
for half so boldely can there no man believe falsely 
swearen and lien as a woman can  
i say not this by wives that be wise  
but if it be when they them misadvise  
a wise wife  if that she can her good  
shall beare them on hand the cow is wood  
and take witness of her owen maid 
of their assent  but hearken how i said  
 sir olde kaynard  is this thine array  
why is my neigheboure s wife so gay  
she is honour d over all where she go th  soever 
i sit at home  i have no thrifty cloth  
what dost thou at my neigheboure s house  
is she so fair  art thou so amorous  
what rown st thou with our maid  benedicite  
sir olde lechour  let thy japes be  
and if i have a gossip  or a friend 
withoute guilt  thou chidest as a fiend  
if that i walk or play unto his house  
thou comest home as drunken as a mouse  
and preachest on thy bench  with evil prefe  
thou say st to me  it is a great mischief 
to wed a poore woman  for costage  
and if that she be rich  of high parage  
then say st thou  that it is a tormentry 
to suffer her pride and melancholy  
and if that she be fair  thou very knave  
thou say st that every holour will her have  
she may no while in chastity abide  
that is assailed upon every side  
thou say st some folk desire us for richess  
some for our shape  and some for our fairness  
and some  for she can either sing or dance  
and some for gentiless and dalliance  
some for her handes and her armes smale  
thus goes all to the devil  by thy tale  
thou say st  men may not keep a castle wall 
that may be so assailed over all  
and if that she be foul  thou say st that she 
coveteth every man that she may see  
for as a spaniel she will on him leap  
till she may finde some man her to cheap  
and none so grey goose goes there in the lake  
so say st thou that will be without a make  
and say st  it is a hard thing for to weld 
a thing that no man will  his thankes  held  
thus say st thou  lorel  when thou go st to bed  od for nothing 
and that no wise man needeth for to wed  
nor no man that intendeth unto heaven  
with wilde thunder dint and fiery leven 
mote thy wicked necke be to broke  
thou say st  that dropping houses  and eke smoke  
and chiding wives  make men to flee 
out of their owne house  ah  ben dicite  
what aileth such an old man for to chide  
thou say st  we wives will our vices hide  
till we be fast  and then we will them shew  
well may that be a proverb of a shrew  
thou say st  that oxen  asses  horses  hounds  
they be assayed at diverse stounds  
basons and lavers  ere that men them buy  seasons 
spoones  stooles  and all such husbandry  
and so be pots  and clothes  and array  
but folk of wives make none assay  
till they be wedded    olde dotard shrew    
and then  say st thou  we will our vices shew  
thou say st also  that it displeaseth me  
but if that thou wilt praise my beauty  
and but thou pore alway upon my face  
and call me faire dame in every place  
and but thou make a feast on thilke day 
that i was born  and make me fresh and gay  
and but thou do to my norice honour  
and to my chamberere within my bow r  
and to my father s folk  and mine allies  
thus sayest thou  old barrel full of lies  
and yet also of our prentice jenkin  
for his crisp hair  shining as gold so fine  
and for he squireth me both up and down  
yet hast thou caught a false suspicioun  
i will him not  though thou wert dead to morrow  
but tell me this  why hidest thou  with sorrow  
the keyes of thy chest away from me  
it is my good as well as thine  pardie  
what  think st to make an idiot of our dame  
now  by that lord that called is saint jame  
thou shalt not both  although that thou wert wood  
be master of my body  and my good  
the one thou shalt forego  maugre thine eyen  
what helpeth it of me t inquire and spyen  
i trow thou wouldest lock me in thy chest  
thou shouldest say   fair wife  go where thee lest  
take your disport  i will believe no tales  
i know you for a true wife  dame ales   
we love no man  that taketh keep or charge 
where that we go  we will be at our large  
of alle men most blessed may he be  
the wise astrologer dan ptolemy  
that saith this proverb in his almagest  
 of alle men his wisdom is highest  
that recketh not who hath the world in hand  
by this proverb thou shalt well understand  
have thou enough  what thar thee reck or care 
how merrily that other folkes fare  
for certes  olde dotard  by your leave  
ye shall have  pleasure  right enough at eve  
he is too great a niggard that will werne 
a man to light a candle at his lantern  
he shall have never the less light  pardie  
have thou enough  thee thar not plaine thee 
thou say st also  if that we make us gay 
with clothing and with precious array  
that it is peril of our chastity  
and yet    with sorrow    thou enforcest thee  
and say st these words in the apostle s name  
 in habit made with chastity and shame 
ye women shall apparel you   quoth he  
 and not in tressed hair and gay perrie  
as pearles  nor with gold  nor clothes rich   
after thy text nor after thy rubrich 
i will not work as muchel as a gnat  
thou say st also  i walk out like a cat  
for whoso woulde singe the catte s skin 
then will the catte well dwell in her inn  
and if the catte s skin be sleek and gay  
she will not dwell in house half a day  
but forth she will  ere any day be daw d  
to shew her skin  and go a caterwaw d  
this is to say  if i be gay  sir shrew  
i will run out  my borel for to shew  
sir olde fool  what helpeth thee to spyen  
though thou pray argus with his hundred eyen 
to be my wardecorps  as he can best 
in faith he shall not keep me  but me lest  
yet could i make his beard  so may i the  
 thou sayest eke  that there be thinges three  
which thinges greatly trouble all this earth  
and that no wighte may endure the ferth  
o lefe sir shrew  may jesus short thy life  
yet preachest thou  and say st  a hateful wife 
y reckon d is for one of these mischances  
be there none other manner resemblances 
that ye may liken your parables unto  comparison 
but if a silly wife be one of tho  
thou likenest a woman s love to hell  
to barren land where water may not dwell  
thou likenest it also to wild fire  
the more it burns  the more it hath desire 
to consume every thing that burnt will be  
thou sayest  right as wormes shend a tree  
right so a wife destroyeth her husbond  
this know they well that be to wives bond   
lordings  right thus  as ye have understand  
bare i stiffly mine old husbands on hand  
that thus they saiden in their drunkenness  
and all was false  but that i took witness 
on jenkin  and upon my niece also  
o lord  the pain i did them  and the woe  
 full guilteless  by godde s sweete pine  
for as a horse i coulde bite and whine  
i coulde plain  an  i was in the guilt  
or elles oftentime i had been spilt 
whoso first cometh to the nilll  first grint  
i plained first  so was our war y stint  
they were full glad to excuse them full blive 
of things that they never aguilt their live  
 
of wenches would i beare them on hand  
when that for sickness scarcely might they stand  
yet tickled i his hearte for that he 
ween d that i had of him so great cherte  
i swore that all my walking out by night 
was for to espy wenches that he dight  
under that colour had i many a mirth  
for all such wit is given us at birth  
deceit  weeping  and spinning  god doth give 
to women kindly  while that they may live  
and thus of one thing i may vaunte me  
at th  end i had the better in each degree  
by sleight  or force  or by some manner thing  
as by continual murmur or grudging  
namely a bed  there hadde they mischance  
there would i chide  and do them no pleasance  
i would no longer in the bed abide  
if that i felt his arm over my side  
till he had made his ransom unto me  
then would i suffer him do his nicety  
and therefore every man this tale i tell  
win whoso may  for all is for to sell  
with empty hand men may no hawkes lure  
for winning would i all his will endure  
and make me a feigned appetite  
and yet in bacon had i never delight  
that made me that i ever would them chide  
for  though the pope had sitten them beside  
i would not spare them at their owen board  
for  by my troth  i quit them word for word 
as help me very god omnipotent  
though i right now should make my testament 
i owe them not a word  that is not quit 
i brought it so aboute by my wit  
that they must give it up  as for the best 
or elles had we never been in rest  
for  though he looked as a wood lion  
yet should he fail of his conclusion  
then would i say   now  goode lefe tak keep 
how meekly looketh wilken oure sheep  
come near  my spouse  and let me ba thy cheek 
ye shoulde be all patient and meek  
and have a sweet y spiced conscience  
since ye so preach of jobe s patience  
suffer alway  since ye so well can preach  
and but ye do  certain we shall you teach 
that it is fair to have a wife in peace  
one of us two must bowe doubteless  
and since a man is more reasonable 
than woman is  ye must be suff rable  
what aileth you to grudge thus and groan  
is it for ye would have my  love  alone  
why  take it all  lo  have it every deal  
peter  shrew you but ye love it well 
for if i woulde sell my belle chose  
i coulde walk as fresh as is a rose  
but i will keep it for your owen tooth  
ye be to blame  by god  i say you sooth   
such manner wordes hadde we on hand  
now will i speaken of my fourth husband  
my fourthe husband was a revellour  
this is to say  he had a paramour  
and i was young and full of ragerie  
stubborn and strong  and jolly as a pie  
then could i dance to a harpe smale  
and sing  y wis  as any nightingale  
when i had drunk a draught of sweete wine  
metellius  the foule churl  the swine  
that with a staff bereft his wife of life 
for she drank wine  though i had been his wife  
never should he have daunted me from drink  
and  after wine  of venus most i think  
for all so sure as cold engenders hail  
a liquorish mouth must have a liquorish tail  
in woman vinolent is no defence  
this knowe lechours by experience  
but  lord christ  when that it rememb reth me 
upon my youth  and on my jollity  
it tickleth me about mine hearte root  
unto this day it doth mine hearte boot  
that i have had my world as in my time  
but age  alas  that all will envenime  
hath me bereft my beauty and my pith  
let go  farewell  the devil go therewith  
the flour is gon  there is no more to tell  
the bran  as i best may  now must i sell  
but yet to be right merry will i fand  
now forth to tell you of my fourth husband  
i say  i in my heart had great despite  
that he of any other had delight  
but he was quit  by god and by saint joce  
i made for him of the same wood a cross  
not of my body in no foul mannere  
but certainly i made folk such cheer  
that in his owen grease i made him fry 
for anger  and for very jealousy  
by god  in earth i was his purgatory  
for which i hope his soul may be in glory  
for  god it wot  he sat full oft and sung  
when that his shoe full bitterly him wrung  
there was no wight  save god and he  that wist 
in many wise how sore i did him twist  
he died when i came from jerusalem  
and lies in grave under the roode beam  
although his tomb is not so curious 
as was the sepulchre of darius  
which that apelles wrought so subtlely  
it is but waste to bury them preciously  
let him fare well  god give his soule rest  
he is now in his grave and in his chest  
now of my fifthe husband will i tell  
god let his soul never come into hell  
and yet was he to me the moste shrew  
that feel i on my ribbes all by rew  
and ever shall  until mine ending day  
but in our bed he was so fresh and gay  
and therewithal so well he could me glose  
when that he woulde have my belle chose  
though he had beaten me on every bone  
yet could he win again my love anon  
i trow  i lov d him better  for that he 
was of his love so dangerous to me  
we women have  if that i shall not lie  
in this matter a quainte fantasy  
whatever thing we may not lightly have  
thereafter will we cry all day and crave  
forbid us thing  and that desire we  
press on us fast  and thenne will we flee  
with danger utter we all our chaffare  
great press at market maketh deare ware  
and too great cheap is held at little price  
this knoweth every woman that is wise  
my fifthe husband  god his soule bless  
which that i took for love and no richess  
he some time was a clerk of oxenford  a scholar of oxford 
and had left school  and went at home to board 
with my gossip  dwelling in oure town  dmother 
god have her soul  her name was alisoun  
she knew my heart  and all my privity  
bet than our parish priest  so may i the  
to her betrayed i my counsel all  
for had my husband pissed on a wall  
or done a thing that should have cost his life  
to her  and to another worthy wife  
and to my niece  which that i loved well  
i would have told his counsel every deal  
and so i did full often  god it wot  
that made his face full often red and hot 
for very shame  and blam d himself  for he 
had told to me so great a privity  
and so befell that ones in a lent 
so oftentimes i to my gossip went  
for ever yet i loved to be gay  
and for to walk in march  april  and may 
from house to house  to heare sundry tales  
that jenkin clerk  and my gossip  dame ales  
and i myself  into the fieldes went  
mine husband was at london all that lent  
i had the better leisure for to play  
and for to see  and eke for to be sey 
of lusty folk  what wist i where my grace 
was shapen for to be  or in what place  
therefore made i my visitations 
to vigilies  and to processions  
to preachings eke  and to these pilgrimages  
to plays of miracles  and marriages  
and weared upon me gay scarlet gites  
these wormes  nor these mothes  nor these mites 
on my apparel frett them never a deal 
and know st thou why  for they were used well  
now will i telle forth what happen d me  
i say  that in the fieldes walked we  
till truely we had such dalliance  
this clerk and i  that of my purveyance 
i spake to him  and told him how that he  
if i were widow  shoulde wedde me  
for certainly  i say for no bobance  
yet was i never without purveyance 
of marriage  nor of other thinges eke  
i hold a mouse s wit not worth a leek  
that hath but one hole for to starte to  
and if that faile  then is all y do  
 i bare him on hand he had enchanted me 
my dame taughte me that subtilty  
and eke i said  i mette of him all night  
he would have slain me  as i lay upright  
and all my bed was full of very blood  
but yet i hop d that he should do me good  
for blood betoken d gold  as me was taught  
and all was false  i dream d of him right naught  
but as i follow d aye my dame s lore  
as well of that as of other things more   
but now  sir  let me see  what shall i sayn  
aha  by god  i have my tale again  
when that my fourthe husband was on bier  
i wept algate and made a sorry cheer  
as wives must  for it is the usage  
and with my kerchief covered my visage  
but  for i was provided with a make  
i wept but little  that i undertake 
to churche was mine husband borne a morrow 
with neighebours that for him made sorrow  
and jenkin  oure clerk  was one of tho  
as help me god  when that i saw him go 
after the bier  methought he had a pair 
of legges and of feet so clean and fair  
that all my heart i gave unto his hold  
he was  i trow  a twenty winter old  
and i was forty  if i shall say sooth  
but yet i had always a colte s tooth  
gat toothed i was  and that became me well  
i had the print of sainte venus  seal  
 as help me god  i was a lusty one  
and fair  and rich  and young  and well begone  
for certes i am all venerian under the influence of venus 
in feeling  and my heart is martian  under the influence of mars 
venus me gave my lust and liquorishness  
and mars gave me my sturdy hardiness   
mine ascendant was taure  and mars therein  
alas  alas  that ever love was sin  
i follow d aye mine inclination 
by virtue of my constellation  
that made me that i coulde not withdraw 
my chamber of venus from a good fellaw  
 yet have i marte s mark upon my face  
and also in another privy place  
for god so wisly be my salvation  
i loved never by discretion  
but ever follow d mine own appetite  
all were he short  or long  or black  or white  
i took no keep  so that he liked me  
how poor he was  neither of what degree   
what should i say  but that at the month s end 
this jolly clerk jenkin  that was so hend  
had wedded me with great solemnity  
and to him gave i all the land and fee 
that ever was me given therebefore  
but afterward repented me full sore  
he woulde suffer nothing of my list  
by god  he smote me ones with his fist  
for that i rent out of his book a leaf  
that of the stroke mine eare wax d all deaf  
stubborn i was  as is a lioness  
and of my tongue a very jangleress  
and walk i would  as i had done beforn  
from house to house  although he had it sworn  
for which he oftentimes woulde preach prevent it 
and me of olde roman gestes teach stories 
how that sulpitius gallus left his wife 
and her forsook for term of all his 
for nought but open headed he her say 
looking out at his door upon a day  
another roman told he me by name  
that  for his wife was at a summer game 
without his knowing  he forsook her eke  
and then would he upon his bible seek 
that ilke proverb of ecclesiast  
where he commandeth  and forbiddeth fast  
man shall not suffer his wife go roll about  
then would he say right thus withoute doubt  
 whoso that buildeth his house all of sallows  
and pricketh his blind horse over the fallows  
and suff reth his wife to seeke hallows  
is worthy to be hanged on the gallows   
but all for nought  i sette not a haw 
of his proverbs  nor of his olde saw  
nor would i not of him corrected be  
i hate them that my vices telle me  
and so do more of us god wot than i  
this made him wood with me all utterly  
i woulde not forbear him in no case  
now will i say you sooth  by saint thomas  
why that i rent out of his book a leaf  
for which he smote me  so that i was deaf  
he had a book  that gladly night and day 
for his disport he would it read alway  
he call d it valerie  and theophrast  
and with that book he laugh d alway full fast  
and eke there was a clerk sometime at rome  
a cardinal  that highte saint jerome  
that made a book against jovinian  
which book was there  and eke tertullian  
chrysippus  trotula  and heloise  
that was an abbess not far from paris  
and eke the parables of solomon  
ovide s art  and bourdes many one  
and alle these were bound in one volume  
and every night and day was his custume 
when he had leisure and vacation 
from other worldly occupation 
to readen in this book of wicked wives  
he knew of them more legends and more lives 
than be of goodde wives in the bible  
for  trust me well  it is an impossible 
that any clerk will speake good of wives  
but if it be of holy saintes  lives 
nor of none other woman never the mo   
who painted the lion  tell it me  who  
by god  if women haddde written stories  
as clerkes have within their oratories  
they would have writ of men more wickedness 
than all the mark of adam may redress 
the children of mercury and of venus  
be in their working full contrarious  
mercury loveth wisdom and science  
and venus loveth riot and dispence  
and for their diverse disposition  
each falls in other s exaltation  
as thus  god wot  mercury is desolate 
in pisces  where venus is exaltate  
and venus falls where mercury is raised  
therefore no woman by no clerk is praised  
the clerk  when he is old  and may not do 
of venus  works not worth his olde shoe  
then sits he down  and writes in his dotage  
that women cannot keep their marriage  
but now to purpose  why i tolde thee 
that i was beaten for a book  pardie  
upon a night jenkin  that was our sire  
read on his book  as he sat by the fire  
of eva first  that for her wickedness 
was all mankind brought into wretchedness  
for which that jesus christ himself was slain  
that bought us with his hearte blood again  
lo here express of women may ye find 
that woman was the loss of all mankind  
then read he me how samson lost his hairs 
sleeping  his leman cut them with her shears  
through whiche treason lost he both his eyen  
then read he me  if that i shall not lien  
of hercules  and of his dejanire  
that caused him to set himself on fire  
nothing forgot he of the care and woe 
that socrates had with his wives two  
how xantippe cast piss upon his head  
this silly man sat still  as he were dead  
he wip d his head  and no more durst he sayn  
but   ere the thunder stint there cometh rain   
of phasiphae  that was queen of crete  
for shrewedness he thought the tale sweet  
fy  speak no more  it is a grisly thing  
of her horrible lust and her liking  
of clytemnestra  for her lechery 
that falsely made her husband for to die  
he read it with full good devotion  
he told me eke  for what occasion 
amphiorax at thebes lost his life  
my husband had a legend of his wife 
eryphile  that for an ouche of gold 
had privily unto the greekes told  
where that her husband hid him in a place  
for which he had at thebes sorry grace  
of luna told he me  and of lucie  
they bothe made their husbands for to die  
that one for love  that other was for hate  
luna her husband on an ev ning late 
empoison d had  for that she was his foe  
lucia liquorish lov d her husband so  
that  for he should always upon her think  
she gave him such a manner love drink  
that he was dead before it were the morrow  
and thus algates husbands hadde sorrow  
then told he me how one latumeus 
complained to his fellow arius 
that in his garden growed such a tree  
on which he said how that his wives three 
hanged themselves for heart dispiteous  
 o leve brother   quoth this arius  
 give me a plant of thilke blessed tree  
and in my garden planted shall it be   
of later date of wives hath he read  
that some have slain their husbands in their bed  
and let their lechour dight them all the night  
while that the corpse lay on the floor upright  
and some have driven nails into their brain  
while that they slept  and thus they have them slain  
some have them given poison in their drink  
he spake more harm than hearte may bethink  
and therewithal he knew of more proverbs  
than in this world there groweth grass or herbs  
 better quoth he thine habitation 
be with a lion  or a foul dragon  
than with a woman using for to chide  
better quoth he high in the roof abide  
than with an angry woman in the house  
they be so wicked and contrarious  
they hate that their husbands loven aye   
he said   a woman cast her shame away 
when she cast off her smock   and farthermo   
 a fair woman  but she be chaste also  
is like a gold ring in a sowe s nose  
who coulde ween  or who coulde suppose 
the woe that in mine heart was  and the pine  
and when i saw that he would never fine 
to readen on this cursed book all night  
all suddenly three leaves have i plight 
out of his book  right as he read  and eke 
i with my fist so took him on the cheek  
that in our fire he backward fell adown  
and he up start  as doth a wood lion  
and with his fist he smote me on the head  
that on the floor i lay as i were dead  
and when he saw how still that there i lay  
he was aghast  and would have fled away  
till at the last out of my swoon i braid  
 oh  hast thou slain me  thou false thief   i said 
 and for my land thus hast thou murder d me  
ere i be dead  yet will i kisse thee   
and near he came  and kneeled fair adown  
and saide    deare sister alisoun  
as help me god  i shall thee never smite  
that i have done it is thyself to wite  
forgive it me  and that i thee beseek   
and yet eftsoons i hit him on the cheek  
and saidde   thief  thus much am i awreak  
now will i die  i may no longer speak   
but at the last  with muche care and woe 
we fell accorded by ourselves two  
he gave me all the bridle in mine hand 
to have the governance of house and land  
and of his tongue  and of his hand also  
i made him burn his book anon right tho  
and when that i had gotten unto me 
by mast ry all the sovereignety  
and that he said   mine owen true wife  
do as thee list  the term of all thy life  
keep thine honour  and eke keep mine estate  
after that day we never had debate  
god help me so  i was to him as kind 
as any wife from denmark unto ind  
and also true  and so was he to me  
i pray to god that sits in majesty 
so bless his soule  for his mercy dear  
now will i say my tale  if ye will hear    
the friar laugh d when he had heard all this  
 now  dame   quoth he   so have i joy and bliss  
this is a long preamble of a tale   
and when the sompnour heard the friar gale  
 lo   quoth this sompnour   godde s armes two  
a friar will intermete him evermo   
lo  goode men  a fly and eke a frere 
will fall in ev ry dish and eke mattere  
what speak st thou of perambulation  preamble 
what  amble or trot  or peace  or go sit down  
thou lettest our disport in this mattere   esst 
 yea  wilt thou so  sir sompnour   quoth the frere  
 now by my faith i shall  ere that i go  
tell of a sompnour such a tale or two  
that all the folk shall laughen in this place   
 now do  else  friar  i beshrew thy face   
quoth this sompnour   and i beshrewe me  
but if i telle tales two or three 
of friars  ere i come to sittingbourne  
that i shall make thine hearte for to mourn  
for well i wot thy patience is gone   
our hoste cried   peace  and that anon   
and saide   let the woman tell her tale  
ye fare as folk that drunken be of ale  
do  dame  tell forth your tale  and that is best   
 all ready  sir   quoth she   right as you lest  
if i have licence of this worthy frere   
 yes  dame   quoth he   tell forth  and i will hear   
 
the tale  
 
in olde dayes of the king arthour  
of which that britons speake great honour  
all was this land full fill d of faerie  
the elf queen  with her jolly company  
danced full oft in many a green mead 
this was the old opinion  as i read  
i speak of many hundred years ago  
but now can no man see none elves mo   
for now the great charity and prayeres 
of limitours  and other holy freres  
that search every land and ev ry stream 
as thick as motes in the sunne beam  
blessing halls  chambers  kitchenes  and bowers  
cities and burghes  castles high and towers  
thorpes and barnes  shepens and dairies  
this makes that there be now no faeries  
for there as wont to walke was an elf  
there walketh now the limitour himself  
in undermeles and in morrowings   
and saith his matins and his holy things  
as he goes in his limitatioun  
women may now go safely up and down  
in every bush  and under every tree  
there is none other incubus but he  
and he will do to them no dishonour  
and so befell it  that this king arthour 
had in his house a lusty bacheler  
that on a day came riding from river  
and happen d  that  alone as she was born  
he saw a maiden walking him beforn  
of which maiden anon  maugre her head  
by very force he reft her maidenhead  
for which oppression was such clamour  
and such pursuit unto the king arthour  
that damned was this knight for to be dead 
by course of law  and should have lost his head  
paraventure such was the statute tho  
but that the queen and other ladies mo  
so long they prayed the king of his grace  
till he his life him granted in the place  
and gave him to the queen  all at her will 
to choose whether she would him save or spill 
the queen thanked the king with all her might  
and  after this  thus spake she to the knight  
when that she saw her time upon a day  
 thou standest yet   quoth she   in such array  
that of thy life yet hast thou no surety  
i grant thee life  if thou canst tell to me 
what thing is it that women most desiren  
beware  and keep thy neck bone from the iron 
and if thou canst not tell it me anon  
yet will i give thee leave for to gon 
a twelvemonth and a day  to seek and lear 
an answer suffisant in this mattere  
and surety will i have  ere that thou pace  
thy body for to yielden in this place   
woe was the knight  and sorrowfully siked  
but what  he might not do all as him liked  
and at the last he chose him for to wend  
and come again  right at the yeare s end  
with such answer as god would him purvey  
and took his leave  and wended forth his way  
he sought in ev ry house and ev ry place  
where as he hoped for to finde grace  
to learne what thing women love the most  
but he could not arrive in any coast  
where as he mighte find in this mattere 
two creatures according in fere  
some said that women loved best richess  
some said honour  and some said jolliness  
some rich array  and some said lust a bed  
and oft time to be widow and be wed  
some said  that we are in our heart most eased 
when that we are y flatter d and y praised  
he went full nigh the sooth  i will not lie  
a man shall win us best with flattery  the truth 
and with attendance  and with business 
be we y limed  bothe more and less  
and some men said that we do love the best 
for to be free  and do right as us lest  
and that no man reprove us of our vice  
but say that we are wise  and nothing nice  
for truly there is none among us all  
if any wight will claw us on the gall  
that will not kick  for that he saith us sooth  
assay  and he shall find it  that so do th  
for be we never so vicious within  
we will be held both wise and clean of sin  
and some men said  that great delight have we 
for to be held stable and eke secre  discreet 
and in one purpose steadfastly to dwell  
and not bewray a thing that men us tell  
but that tale is not worth a rake stele  
pardie  we women canne nothing hele  
witness on midas  will ye hear the tale  
ovid  amonges other thinges smale 
saith  midas had  under his longe hairs  
growing upon his head two ass s ears  
the whiche vice he hid  as best he might  
full subtlely from every man s sight  
that  save his wife  there knew of it no mo   
he lov d her most  and trusted her also  
he prayed her  that to no creature 
she woulde tellen of his disfigure  
she swore him  nay  for all the world to win  
she would not do that villainy or sin  
to make her husband have so foul a name  
she would not tell it for her owen shame  
but natheless her thoughte that she died  
that she so longe should a counsel hide  
her thought it swell d so sore about her heart 
that needes must some word from her astart 
and  since she durst not tell it unto man 
down to a marish fast thereby she ran  
till she came there  her heart was all afire  
and  as a bittern bumbles in the mire  
she laid her mouth unto the water down 
 bewray me not  thou water  with thy soun   
quoth she   to thee i tell it  and no mo   
mine husband hath long ass s eares two  
now is mine heart all whole  now is it out  
i might no longer keep it  out of doubt   
here may ye see  though we a time abide  
yet out it must  we can no counsel hide  
the remnant of the tale  if ye will hear  
read in ovid  and there ye may it lear  
this knight  of whom my tale is specially  
when that he saw he might not come thereby  
that is to say  what women love the most  
within his breast full sorrowful was his ghost  
but home he went  for he might not sojourn  
the day was come  that homeward he must turn  
and in his way it happen d him to ride  
in all his care  under a forest side  
where as he saw upon a dance go 
of ladies four and twenty  and yet mo   
toward this ilke dance he drew full yern  
the hope that he some wisdom there should learn  
but certainly  ere he came fully there  
y vanish d was this dance  he knew not where  
no creature saw he that bare life  
save on the green he sitting saw a wife  
a fouler wight there may no man devise  
against this knight this old wife gan to rise  
and said   sir knight  hereforth lieth no way  
tell me what ye are seeking  by your fay  
paraventure it may the better be  
these olde folk know muche thing   quoth she  
my leve mother   quoth this knight   certain  
i am but dead  but if that i can sayn 
what thing it is that women most desire  
could ye me wiss  i would well quite your hire   
 plight me thy troth here in mine hand   quoth she  
 the nexte thing that i require of thee 
thou shalt it do  if it be in thy might  
and i will tell it thee ere it be night   
 have here my trothe   quoth the knight   i grant   
 thenne   quoth she   i dare me well avaunt  
thy life is safe  for i will stand thereby  
upon my life the queen will say as i  
let see  which is the proudest of them all  
that wears either a kerchief or a caul  
that dare say nay to that i shall you teach  
let us go forth withoute longer speech 
then rowned she a pistel in his ear  
and bade him to be glad  and have no fear  
when they were come unto the court  this knight 
said  he had held his day  as he had hight  
and ready was his answer  as he said  
full many a noble wife  and many a maid  
and many a widow  for that they be wise    
the queen herself sitting as a justice    
assembled be  his answer for to hear  
and afterward this knight was bid appear  
to every wight commanded was silence  
and that the knight should tell in audience  
what thing that worldly women love the best  
this knight he stood not still  as doth a beast  
but to this question anon answer d 
with manly voice  that all the court it heard  
 my liege lady  generally   quoth he  
 women desire to have the sovereignty 
as well over their husband as their love 
and for to be in mast ry him above  
this is your most desire  though ye me kill  
do as you list  i am here at your will   
in all the court there was no wife nor maid 
nor widow  that contraried what he said  
but said  he worthy was to have his life  
and with that word up start that olde wife 
which that the knight saw sitting on the green  
 mercy   quoth she   my sovereign lady queen  
ere that your court departe  do me right  
i taughte this answer unto this knight  
for which he plighted me his trothe there  
the firste thing i would of him requere  
he would it do  if it lay in his might  
before this court then pray i thee  sir knight   
quoth she   that thou me take unto thy wife  
for well thou know st that i have kept thy life  
if i say false  say nay  upon thy fay   
this knight answer d   alas  and well away  
i know right well that such was my behest  
for godde s love choose a new request 
take all my good  and let my body go   
 nay  then   quoth she   i shrew us bothe two  
for though that i be old  and foul  and poor  
i n ould for all the metal nor the ore  would not 
that under earth is grave  or lies above 
but if thy wife i were and eke thy love   
 my love   quoth he   nay  my damnation  
alas  that any of my nation 
should ever so foul disparaged be  
but all for nought  the end is this  that he 
constrained was  that needs he muste wed  
and take this olde wife  and go to bed  
now woulde some men say paraventure 
that for my negligence i do no cure no pains 
to tell you all the joy and all th  array 
that at the feast was made that ilke day  
to which thing shortly answeren i shall  
i say there was no joy nor feast at all  
there was but heaviness and muche sorrow  
for privily he wed her on the morrow  
and all day after hid him as an owl  
so woe was him  his wife look d so foul 
great was the woe the knight had in his thought 
when he was with his wife to bed y brought  
he wallow d  and he turned to and fro  
this olde wife lay smiling evermo   
and said   dear husband  benedicite  
fares every knight thus with his wife as ye  
is this the law of king arthoures house  
is every knight of his thus dangerous  
i am your owen love  and eke your wife 
i am she  which that saved hath your life 
and certes yet did i you ne er unright  
why fare ye thus with me this firste night  
ye fare like a man had lost his wit  
what is my guilt  for god s love tell me it  
and it shall be amended  if i may   
 amended   quoth this knight   alas  nay  nay  
it will not be amended  never mo   
thou art so loathly  and so old also  
and thereto comest of so low a kind  
that little wonder though i wallow and wind  
so woulde god  mine hearte woulde brest   
 is this   quoth she   the cause of your unrest   
 yea  certainly   quoth he   no wonder is   
 now  sir   quoth she   i could amend all this  
if that me list  ere it were dayes three  
so well ye mighte bear you unto me  
but  for ye speaken of such gentleness yourself well 
as is descended out of old richess  towards me 
that therefore shalle ye be gentlemen  
such arrogancy is not worth a hen  
look who that is most virtuous alway  
prive and apert  and most intendeth aye 
to do the gentle deedes that he can  
and take him for the greatest gentleman  
christ will  we claim of him our gentleness  
not of our elders for their old richess  
for though they gave us all their heritage  
for which we claim to be of high parage  
yet may they not bequeathe  for no thing  
to none of us  their virtuous living 
that made them gentlemen called to be  
and bade us follow them in such degree  
well can the wise poet of florence  
that highte dante  speak of this sentence  
lo  in such manner rhyme is dante s tale  
 full seld  upriseth by his branches smale 
prowess of man  for god of his goodness 
wills that we claim of him our gentleness   
for of our elders may we nothing claim 
but temp ral things that man may hurt and maim  
eke every wight knows this as well as i  
if gentleness were planted naturally 
unto a certain lineage down the line  
prive and apert  then would they never fine 
to do of gentleness the fair office 
then might they do no villainy nor vice  
take fire  and bear it to the darkest house 
betwixt this and the mount of caucasus  
and let men shut the doores  and go thenne  
yet will the fire as fair and lighte brenne 
as twenty thousand men might it behold  
its office natural aye will it hold  
on peril of my life  till that it die  
here may ye see well how that gentery 
is not annexed to possession  
since folk do not their operation 
alway  as doth the fire  lo  in its kind 
for  god it wot  men may full often find 
a lorde s son do shame and villainy  
and he that will have price of his gent ry  
for he was boren of a gentle house  because 
and had his elders noble and virtuous  
and will himselfe do no gentle deedes  
nor follow his gentle ancestry  that dead is  
he is not gentle  be he duke or earl  
for villain sinful deedes make a churl  
for gentleness is but the renomee 
of thine ancestors  for their high bounte  
which is a strange thing to thy person  
thy gentleness cometh from god alone  
then comes our very gentleness of grace  
it was no thing bequeath d us with our place  
think how noble  as saith valerius  
was thilke tullius hostilius  
that out of povert  rose to high 
read in senec  and read eke in boece  
there shall ye see express  that it no drede is  
that he is gentle that doth gentle deedes  
and therefore  leve husband  i conclude  
albeit that mine ancestors were rude  
yet may the highe god    and so hope i    
grant me his grace to live virtuously  
then am i gentle when that i begin 
to live virtuously  and waive sin  
 and whereas ye of povert  me repreve  
the highe god  on whom that we believe  
in wilful povert  chose to lead his life  
and certes  every man  maiden  or wife 
may understand that jesus  heaven s king  
ne would not choose a virtuous living  
glad povert  is an honest thing  certain  
this will senec and other clerkes sayn endured 
whoso that holds him paid of his povert   
i hold him rich though he hath not a shirt  
he that coveteth is a poore wight 
for he would have what is not in his might 
but he that nought hath  nor coveteth to have  
is rich  although ye hold him but a knave  
very povert  is sinne  properly  
juvenal saith of povert  merrily  
the poore man  when he goes by the way 
before the thieves he may sing and play 
povert  is hateful good  and  as i guess  
a full great bringer out of business  
a great amender eke of sapience 
to him that taketh it in patience  
povert  is this  although it seem elenge 
possession that no wight will challenge 
povert  full often  when a man is low  
makes him his god and eke himself to know 
povert  a spectacle is  as thinketh me 
through which he may his very friendes see  
and  therefore  sir  since that i you not grieve  
of my povert  no more me repreve  
 now  sir  of elde ye repreve me  
and certes  sir  though none authority 
were in no book  ye gentles of honour 
say  that men should an olde wight honour  
and call him father  for your gentleness  
and authors shall i finden  as i guess  
now there ye say that i am foul and old  
then dread ye not to be a cokewold  
for filth  and elde  all so may i the  
be greate wardens upon chastity  
but natheless  since i know your delight  
i shall fulfil your wordly appetite  
choose now   quoth she   one of these thinges tway  
to have me foul and old till that i dey  
and be to you a true humble wife  
and never you displease in all my life  
or elles will ye have me young and fair  
and take your aventure of the repair 
that shall be to your house because of me    
or in some other place  it may well be  
now choose yourselfe whether that you liketh  
this knight adviseth him and sore he siketh  
but at the last he said in this mannere  
 my lady and my love  and wife so dear  
i put me in your wise governance  
choose for yourself which may be most pleasance 
and most honour to you and me also  
i do no force the whether of the two  
for as you liketh  it sufficeth me   
 then have i got the mastery   quoth she  
 since i may choose and govern as me lest   
 yea  certes wife   quoth he   i hold it best   
 kiss me   quoth she   we are no longer wroth  
for by my troth i will be to you both  
this is to say  yea  bothe fair and good  
i pray to god that i may sterve wood  
but i to you be all so good and true  
as ever was wife since the world was new  
and but i be to morrow as fair to seen  
as any lady  emperess or queen  
that is betwixt the east and eke the west 
do with my life and death right as you lest  
cast up the curtain  and look how it is   
and when the knight saw verily all this  
that she so fair was  and so young thereto  
for joy he hent her in his armes two  
his hearte bathed in a bath of bliss  
a thousand times on row he gan her kiss  
and she obeyed him in every thing 
that mighte do him pleasance or liking  
and thus they live unto their lives  end 
in perfect joy  and jesus christ us send 
husbandes meek and young  and fresh in bed  
and grace to overlive them that we wed  
and eke i pray jesus to short their lives  
that will not be governed by their wives  
and old and angry niggards of dispence  
god send them soon a very pestilence  
 
the friar s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
this worthy limitour  this noble frere  
he made always a manner louring cheer 
upon the sompnour  but for honesty 
no villain word as yet to him spake he  
but at the last he said unto the wife  
 dame   quoth he   god give you right good life  
ye have here touched  all so may i the  
in school matter a greate difficulty  
ye have said muche thing right well  i say  
but  dame  here as we ride by the way  
us needeth not but for to speak of game  
and leave authorities  in godde s name  
to preaching  and to school eke of clergy  
but if it like unto this company  
i will you of a sompnour tell a game  
pardie  ye may well knowe by the name  
that of a sompnour may no good be said  
i pray that none of you be paid  
a sompnour is a runner up and down 
with mandements for fornicatioun  
and is y beat at every towne s end   
then spake our host   ah  sir  ye should be hend 
and courteous  as a man of your estate  
in company we will have no debate  
tell us your tale  and let the sompnour be   
 nay   quoth the sompnour   let him say by me 
what so him list  when it comes to my lot  
by god  i shall him quiten every groat  
i shall him telle what a great honour 
it is to be a flattering limitour 
and his office i shall him tell y wis   
our host answered   peace  no more of this   
and afterward he said unto the frere  
 tell forth your tale  mine owen master dear   
 
the tale  
 
whilom there was dwelling in my country 
an archdeacon  a man of high degree  
that boldely did execution  
in punishing of fornication  
of witchecraft  and eke of bawdery  
of defamation  and adultery  
of churche reeves  and of testaments  
of contracts  and of lack of sacraments  
and eke of many another manner crime  
which needeth not rehearsen at this time  
of usury  and simony also  
but  certes  lechours did he greatest woe  
they shoulde singen  if that they were hent  
and smale tithers were foul y shent  
if any person would on them complain  
there might astert them no pecunial pain  
for smalle tithes  and small offering  
he made the people piteously to sing  
for ere the bishop caught them with his crook  
they weren in the archedeacon s book  
then had he  through his jurisdiction  
power to do on them correction  
he had a sompnour ready to his hand  
a slier boy was none in engleland  
for subtlely he had his espiaille  
that taught him well where it might aught avail  
he coulde spare of lechours one or two  
to teache him to four and twenty mo   
for    though this sompnour wood be as a hare    
to tell his harlotry i will not spare  
for we be out of their correction  
they have of us no jurisdiction  
ne never shall have  term of all their lives  
 peter  so be the women of the stives   
quoth this sompnour   y put out of our cure   
 peace  with mischance and with misaventure   
our hoste said   and let him tell his tale  
now telle forth  and let the sompnour gale  
nor spare not  mine owen master dear   
this false thief  the sompnour quoth the frere  
had always bawdes ready to his hand  
as any hawk to lure in engleland  
that told him all the secrets that they knew    
for their acquaintance was not come of new  
they were his approvers privily  
he took himself at great profit thereby  
his master knew not always what he wan  
withoute mandement  a lewed man 
he could summon  on pain of christe s curse  
and they were inly glad to fill his purse  
and make him greate feastes at the nale  
and right as judas hadde purses smale  
and was a thief  right such a thief was he  
his master had but half his duety  
he was if i shall give him his laud 
a thief  and eke a sompnour  and a bawd  
and he had wenches at his retinue  
that whether that sir robert or sir hugh  
or jack  or ralph  or whoso that it were 
that lay by them  they told it in his ear  
thus were the wench and he of one assent  
and he would fetch a feigned mandement  
and to the chapter summon them both two  
and pill the man  and let the wenche go  
then would he say   friend  i shall for thy sake 
do strike thee out of oure letters blake  
thee thar no more as in this case travail  
i am thy friend where i may thee avail   
certain he knew of bribers many mo  
than possible is to tell in yeare s two  
for in this world is no dog for the bow  
that can a hurt deer from a whole know  
bet than this sompnour knew a sly lechour  
or an adult rer  or a paramour  
and  for that was the fruit of all his rent  
therefore on it he set all his intent  
and so befell  that once upon a day  
this sompnour  waiting ever on his prey  
rode forth to summon a widow  an old ribibe  
feigning a cause  for he would have a bribe  
and happen d that he saw before him ride 
a gay yeoman under a forest side  
a bow he bare  and arrows bright and keen  
he had upon a courtepy of green  
a hat upon his head with fringes blake  
 sir   quoth this sompnour   hail  and well o ertake   
 welcome   quoth he   and every good fellaw  
whither ridest thou under this green shaw   
saide this yeoman   wilt thou far to day   
this sompnour answer d him  and saide   nay  
here faste by   quoth he   is mine intent 
to ride  for to raisen up a rent  
that longeth to my lorde s duety   
 ah  art thou then a bailiff    yea   quoth he  
he durste not for very filth and shame 
say that he was a sompnour  for the name  
 de par dieux   quoth this yeoman   leve brother  
thou art a bailiff  and i am another  
i am unknowen  as in this country  
of thine acquaintance i will praye thee  
and eke of brotherhood  if that thee list  
i have gold and silver lying in my chest  
if that thee hap to come into our shire  
all shall be thine  right as thou wilt desire   
 grand mercy   quoth this sompnour   by my faith   
each in the other s hand his trothe lay th  
for to be sworne brethren till they dey  
in dalliance they ride forth and play  
this sompnour  which that was as full of jangles  
as full of venom be those wariangles  
and ev r inquiring upon every thing  
 brother   quoth he   where is now your dwelling  
another day if that i should you seech   
this yeoman him answered in soft speech  
brother   quoth he   far in the north country  
where as i hope some time i shall thee see 
ere we depart i shall thee so well wiss  
that of mine house shalt thou never miss   
now  brother   quoth this sompnour   i you pray  
teach me  while that we ride by the way  
since that ye be a bailiff as am i  
some subtilty  and tell me faithfully 
for mine office how that i most may win  
and spare not for conscience or for sin  
but  as my brother  tell me how do ye   
now by my trothe  brother mine   said he  
as i shall tell to thee a faithful tale  
my wages be full strait and eke full smale  
my lord is hard to me and dangerous  
and mine office is full laborious  
and therefore by extortion i live  
forsooth i take all that men will me give  
algate by sleighte  or by violence  
from year to year i win all my dispence  
i can no better tell thee faithfully   
now certes   quoth this sompnour   so fare i  
i spare not to take  god it wot  
but if it be too heavy or too hot  
what i may get in counsel privily  
no manner conscience of that have i  
n ere mine extortion  i might not live  
for of such japes will i not be shrive  
stomach nor conscience know i none  
i shrew these shrifte fathers every one  
well be we met  by god and by st jame  
but  leve brother  tell me then thy name   
quoth this sompnour  right in this meane while 
this yeoman gan a little for to smile  
 brother   quoth he   wilt thou that i thee tell  
i am a fiend  my dwelling is in hell  
and here i ride about my purchasing  
to know where men will give me any thing  
my purchase is th  effect of all my rent 
look how thou ridest for the same intent 
to winne good  thou reckest never how  
right so fare i  for ride will i now 
into the worlde s ende for a prey   
 ah   quoth this sompnour   benedicite  what say y   
i weened ye were a yeoman truly  
ye have a manne s shape as well as i 
have ye then a figure determinate 
in helle  where ye be in your estate   
 nay  certainly   quoth he  there have we none  
but when us liketh we can take us one  
or elles make you seem that we be shape 
sometime like a man  or like an ape  
or like an angel can i ride or go  
it is no wondrous thing though it be so  
a lousy juggler can deceive thee  
and pardie  yet can i more craft than he   
 why   quoth the sompnour   ride ye then or gon 
in sundry shapes and not always in one   
 for we   quoth he   will us in such form make  
as most is able our prey for to take   
 what maketh you to have all this labour   
 full many a cause  leve sir sompnour   
saide this fiend   but all thing hath a time  
the day is short and it is passed prime  
and yet have i won nothing in this day  
i will intend to winning  if i may  
and not intend our thinges to declare  
for  brother mine  thy wit is all too bare 
to understand  although i told them thee  
but for thou askest why laboure we  
for sometimes we be godde s instruments 
and meanes to do his commandements  
when that him list  upon his creatures  
in divers acts and in divers figures  
withoute him we have no might certain  
if that him list to stande thereagain  
and sometimes  at our prayer have we leave 
only the body  not the soul  to grieve  
witness on job  whom that we did full woe  
and sometimes have we might on both the two    
this is to say  on soul and body eke  
and sometimes be we suffer d for to seek 
upon a man and do his soul unrest 
and not his body  and all is for the best  
when he withstandeth our temptation  
it is a cause of his salvation  
albeit that it was not our intent 
he should be safe  but that we would him hent  
and sometimes be we servants unto man  
as to the archbishop saint dunstan  
and to th apostle servant eke was i   
 yet tell me   quoth this sompnour   faithfully  
make ye you newe bodies thus alway 
of th  elements   the fiend answered   nay  
sometimes we feign  and sometimes we arise 
with deade bodies  in full sundry wise  
and speak as reas nably  and fair  and well  
as to the pythoness did samuel  
and yet will some men say it was not he  
i no force of your divinity  
but one thing warn i thee  i will not jape  
thou wilt algates weet how we be shape  
thou shalt hereafterward  my brother dear  
come  where thee needeth not of me to lear  
for thou shalt by thine own experience 
conne in a chair to rede of this sentence  to understand 
better than virgil  while he was alive  
or dante also  now let us ride blive  
for i will holde company with thee  
till it be so that thou forsake me   
 nay   quoth this sompnour   that shall ne er betide  
i am a yeoman  that is known full wide  
my trothe will i hold  as in this case  
for though thou wert the devil satanas  
my trothe will i hold to thee  my brother  
as i have sworn  and each of us to other  
for to be true brethren in this case  
and both we go abouten our purchase  
take thou thy part  what that men will thee give  may pick up 
and i shall mine  thus may we bothe live  
and if that any of us have more than other  
let him be true  and part it with his brother   
 i grante   quoth the devil   by my fay   
and with that word they rode forth their way  
and right at th ent ring of the towne s end  
to which this sompnour shope him for to wend  
they saw a cart  that charged was with hay  
which that a carter drove forth on his way  
deep was the way  for which the carte stood  
the carter smote  and cried as he were wood  
 heit scot  heit brok  what  spare ye for the stones  
the fiend quoth he you fetch body and bones  
as farforthly as ever ye were foal d  
so muche woe as i have with you tholed  
the devil have all  horses  and cart  and hay   
the sompnour said   here shall we have a prey   
and near the fiend he drew  as nought ne were  
full privily  and rowned in his ear  
 hearken  my brother  hearken  by thy faith  
hearest thou not  how that the carter saith  
hent it anon  for he hath giv n it thee  
both hay and cart  and eke his capels three   
 nay   quoth the devil   god wot  never a deal  
it is not his intent  trust thou me well  
ask him thyself  if thou not trowest me  
or elles stint a while and thou shalt see   
the carter thwack d his horses on the croup  
and they began to drawen and to stoop  
 heit now   quoth he   there  jesus christ you bless  
and all his handiwork  both more and less  
that was well twight  mine owen liart  boy  
i pray god save thy body  and saint loy  
now is my cart out of the slough  pardie   
 lo  brother   quoth the fiend   what told i thee  
here may ye see  mine owen deare brother  
the churl spake one thing  but he thought another  
let us go forth abouten our voyage  
here win i nothing upon this carriage   
when that they came somewhat out of the town  
this sompnour to his brother gan to rown  
 brother   quoth he   here wons an old rebeck  
that had almost as lief to lose her neck  
as for to give a penny of her good  
i will have twelvepence  though that she be wood  
or i will summon her to our office  
and yet  god wot  of her know i no vice  
but for thou canst not  as in this country  
winne thy cost  take here example of me   
this sompnour clapped at the widow s gate  
 come out   he said   thou olde very trate  
i trow thou hast some friar or priest with thee   
 who clappeth   said this wife   benedicite

to answer to the court of certain things   
 now lord   quoth she   christ jesus  king of kings  
so wis1y helpe me  as i not may  
i have been sick  and that full many a day  
i may not go so far   quoth she   nor ride  
but i be dead  so pricketh it my side  
may i not ask a libel  sir sompnour  
and answer there by my procuratour 
to such thing as men would appose me   
 yes   quoth this sompnour   pay anon  let see

ye know full well that i am poor and old  
kithe your almes upon me poor wretch   
 nay then   quoth he   the foule fiend me fetch

as i will bear away thy newe pan 
for debte  which thou owest me of old    
when that thou madest thine husband cuckold

nor never i was but of my body true  
unto the devil rough and black of hue

and when the devil heard her curse so 
upon her knees  he said in this mannere  
 now  mabily  mine owen mother dear  
is this your will in earnest that ye say   
 the devil   quoth she   so fetch him ere he dey

such paines  that your heartes might agrise  
albeit so  that no tongue may devise    
though that i might a thousand winters tell    
the pains of thilke cursed house of hell 
but for to keep us from that cursed place 
wake we  and pray we jesus  of his grace  
so keep us from the tempter  satanas  
hearken this word  beware as in this case  
the lion sits in his await alway 
to slay the innocent  if that he may  
disposen aye your heartes to withstond 
the fiend that would you make thrall and bond  
he may not tempte you over your might  
for christ will be your champion and your knight  
and pray  that this our sompnour him repent 
of his misdeeds ere that the fiend him hent  
 
the sompnour s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
the sompnour in his stirrups high he stood  
upon this friar his hearte was so wood  
that like an aspen leaf he quoke for ire  
 lordings   quoth he   but one thing i desire  
i you beseech  that of your courtesy  
since ye have heard this false friar lie  
as suffer me i may my tale tell 
this friar boasteth that he knoweth hell  
and  god it wot  that is but little wonder  
friars and fiends be but little asunder  
for  pardie  ye have often time heard tell  
how that a friar ravish d was to hell 
in spirit ones by a visioun  
and  as an angel led him up and down  
to shew him all the paines that there were  
in all the place saw he not a frere  
of other folk he saw enough in woe  
unto the angel spake the friar tho  
 now  sir   quoth he   have friars such a grace  
that none of them shall come into this place   
 yes  quoth the angel   many a millioun   
and unto satanas he led him down  
 and now hath satanas   said he   a tail 
broader than of a carrack is the sail  
hold up thy tail  thou satanas   quoth he  
 shew forth thine erse  and let the friar see 
where is the nest of friars in this place   
and less than half a furlong way of space 
right so as bees swarmen out of a hive  
out of the devil s erse there gan to drive 
a twenty thousand friars on a rout  
and throughout hell they swarmed all about  
and came again  as fast as they may gon  
and in his erse they creeped every one  
he clapt his tail again  and lay full still  
this friar  when he looked had his fill 
upon the torments of that sorry place  
his spirit god restored of his grace 
into his body again  and he awoke  
but natheless for feare yet he quoke  
so was the devil s erse aye in his mind  
that is his heritage  of very kind 
god save you alle  save this cursed frere  
my prologue will i end in this mannere  
 
the tale  
 
lordings  there is in yorkshire  as i guess  
a marshy country called holderness  
in which there went a limitour about 
to preach  and eke to beg  it is no doubt  
and so befell that on a day this frere 
had preached at a church in his mannere  
and specially  above every thing  
excited he the people in his preaching 
to trentals  and to give  for godde s sake  
wherewith men mighte holy houses make  
there as divine service is honour d  
not there as it is wasted and devour d  
nor where it needeth not for to be given  
as to possessioners  that may liven  
thanked be god  in wealth and abundance  
 trentals   said he   deliver from penance 
their friendes  soules  as well old as young  
yea  when that they be hastily y sung    
not for to hold a priest jolly and gay  
he singeth not but one mass in a day  
 deliver out   quoth he   anon the souls  
full hard it is  with flesh hook or with owls 
to be y clawed  or to burn or bake  
now speed you hastily  for christe s sake   
and when this friar had said all his intent  
with qui cum patre forth his way he went  
when folk in church had giv n him what them lest  
he went his way  no longer would he rest  
with scrip and tipped staff  y tucked high  
in every house he gan to pore and pry  up high 
and begged meal and cheese  or elles corn  
his fellow had a staff tipped with horn  
a pair of tables all of ivory  
and a pointel y polish d fetisly  
and wrote alway the names  as he stood  
of all the folk that gave them any good  
askaunce that he woulde for them pray  
 give us a bushel wheat  or malt  or rey  
a godde s kichel  or a trip of cheese  
or elles what you list  we may not chese  
a godde s halfpenny  or a mass penny  
or give us of your brawn  if ye have any  
a dagon of your blanket  leve dame  
our sister dear    lo  here i write your name   
bacon or beef  or such thing as ye find   
a sturdy harlot went them aye behind  
that was their hoste s man  and bare a sack  
and what men gave them  laid it on his back 
and when that he was out at door  anon 
he planed away the names every one  
that he before had written in his tables  
he served them with nifles and with fables    
 nay  there thou liest  thou sompnour   quoth the frere  
 peace   quoth our host   for christe s mother dear  
tell forth thy tale  and spare it not at all   
 so thrive i   quoth this sompnour   so i shall     
so long he went from house to house  till he 
came to a house  where he was wont to be 
refreshed more than in a hundred places 
sick lay the husband man  whose that the place is  
bed rid upon a couche low he lay  
 deus hic   quoth he   o thomas friend  good day   
said this friar  all courteously and soft  
 thomas   quoth he   god yield it you  full oft 
have i upon this bench fared full well  
here have i eaten many a merry meal   
and from the bench he drove away the cat  
and laid adown his potent and his hat  
and eke his scrip  and sat himself adown  
his fellow was y walked into town 
forth with his knave  into that hostelry 
where as he shope him that night to lie

and specially for thy salvation 
have i said many a precious orison  
and for mine other friendes  god them bless  
i have this day been at your church at mess  
and said sermon after my simple wit  
not all after the text of holy writ  
for it is hard to you  as i suppose  
and therefore will i teach you aye the glose  
glosing is a full glorious thing certain  
for letter slayeth  as we clerkes sayn  
there have i taught them to be charitable  
and spend their good where it is reasonable  
and there i saw our dame  where is she   
 yonder i trow that in the yard she be   
saide this man   and she will come anon   
 hey master  welcome be ye by saint john   
saide this wife   how fare ye heartily   
this friar riseth up full courteously  
and her embraceth in his armes narrow  
and kiss th her sweet  and chirketh as a sparrow 
with his lippes   dame   quoth he   right well  
as he that is your servant every deal  
thanked be god  that gave you soul and life  
yet saw i not this day so fair a wife 
in all the churche  god so save me   
 yea  god amend defaultes  sir   quoth she  
 algates welcome be ye  by my fay   
 grand mercy  dame  that have i found alway  
but of your greate goodness  by your leave  
i woulde pray you that ye not you grieve  
i will with thomas speak a little throw  
these curates be so negligent and slow 
to grope tenderly a conscience  
in shrift and preaching is my diligence 
and study in peter s wordes and in paul s  
i walk and fishe christian menne s souls  
to yield our lord jesus his proper rent  
to spread his word is alle mine intent   
 now by your faith  o deare sir   quoth she  
 chide him right well  for sainte charity  
he is aye angry as is a pismire  
though that he have all that he can desire  
though i him wrie at night  and make him warm  
and ov r him lay my leg and eke mine arm  
he groaneth as our boar that lies in sty  
other disport of him right none have i  
i may not please him in no manner case   
 o thomas  je vous dis  thomas  thomas  
this maketh the fiend  this must be amended  
ire is a thing that high god hath defended  
and thereof will i speak a word or two   
 now  master   quoth the wife   ere that i go  
what will ye dine  i will go thereabout   
 now  dame   quoth he   je vous dis sans doute  
had i not of a capon but the liver  
and of your white bread not but a shiver  
and after that a roasted pigge s head  
but i would that for me no beast were dead  
then had i with you homely suffisance  
i am a man of little sustenance  
my spirit hath its fost ring in the bible  
my body is aye so ready and penible staking 
to wake  that my stomach is destroy d  
i pray you  dame  that ye be not annoy d  
though i so friendly you my counsel shew  
by god  i would have told it but to few   
 now  sir   quoth she   but one word ere i go  
my child is dead within these weeke s two  
soon after that ye went out of this town   
 his death saw i by revelatioun   
said this friar   at home in our dortour  
i dare well say  that less than half an hour 
mter his death  i saw him borne to bliss 
in mine vision  so god me wiss  
so did our sexton  and our fermerere  
that have been true friars fifty year    
they may now  god be thanked of his love  
make their jubilee  and walk above  
and up i rose  and all our convent eke  
with many a teare trilling on my cheek  
withoute noise or clattering of bells  
te deum was our song  and nothing else  
save that to christ i bade an orison  
thanking him of my revelation  
for  sir and dame  truste me right well  
our orisons be more effectuel  
and more we see of christe s secret things  
than borel folk  although that they be kings  
we live in povert   and in abstinence  
and borel folk in riches and dispence 
of meat and drink  and in their foul delight  
we have this worlde s lust all in despight 
lazar and dives lived diversely  
and diverse guerdon hadde they thereby  
whoso will pray  he must fast and be clean  
and fat his soul  and keep his body lean 
we fare as saith th  apostle  cloth and food 
suffice us  although they be not full good  
the cleanness and the fasting of us freres 
maketh that christ accepteth our prayeres  
lo  moses forty days and forty night 
fasted  ere that the high god full of might 
spake with him in the mountain of sinai  
with empty womb of fasting many a day 
received he the lawe  that was writ 
with godde s finger  and eli  well ye wit  
in mount horeb  ere he had any speech 
with highe god  that is our live s leech  
he fasted long  and was in contemplance  
aaron  that had the temple in governance  
and eke the other priestes every one  
into the temple when they shoulde gon 
to praye for the people  and do service  
they woulde drinken in no manner wise 
no drinke  which that might them drunken make  
but there in abstinence pray and wake  
lest that they died  take heed what i say   
but they be sober that for the people pray   
ware that  i say   no more  for it sufficeth  
our lord jesus  as holy writ deviseth  
gave us example of fasting and prayeres  
therefore we mendicants  we sely freres  
be wedded to povert  and continence  
to charity  humbless  and abstinence  
to persecution for righteousness  
to weeping  misericorde  and to cleanness  
and therefore may ye see that our prayeres 
i speak of us  we mendicants  we freres  
be to the highe god more acceptable 
than youres  with your feastes at your table  
from paradise first  if i shall not lie  
was man out chased for his gluttony  
and chaste was man in paradise certain  
but hark now  thomas  what i shall thee sayn  
i have no text of it  as i suppose  
but i shall find it in a manner glose  
that specially our sweet lord jesus 
spake this of friars  when he saide thus  
 blessed be they that poor in spirit be  
and so forth all the gospel may ye see  
whether it be liker our profession  
or theirs that swimmen in possession  
fy on their pomp  and on their gluttony  
and on their lewedness  i them defy  
me thinketh they be like jovinian  
fat as a whale  and walking as a swan  
all vinolent as bottle in the spence  
their prayer is of full great reverence  
when they for soules say the psalm of david  
lo   buf  they say  cor meum eructavit  
who follow christe s gospel and his lore 
but we  that humble be  and chaste  and pore  
workers of godde s word  not auditours  
therefore right as a hawk a sours 
up springs into the air  right so prayeres 
of charitable and chaste busy freres 
make their sours to godde s eares two  
thomas  thomas  so may i ride or go  
and by that lord that called is saint ive  
n ere thou our brother  shouldest thou not thrive  
in our chapiter pray we day and night 
to christ  that he thee sende health and might  
thy body for to wielde hastily  
 god wot   quoth he   nothing thereof feel i  
so help me christ  as i in fewe years 
have spended upon divers manner freres 
full many a pound  yet fare i ne er the bet  
certain my good have i almost beset  
farewell my gold  for it is all ago   
the friar answer d   o thomas  dost thou so  
what needest thou diverse friars to seech  
what needeth him that hath a perfect leech  
to seeken other leeches in the town  
your inconstance is your confusioun  
hold ye then me  or elles our convent  
to praye for you insufficient  
thomas  that it is not worth a mite  
your malady is for we have too lite  
ah  give that convent half a quarter oats  too little 
and give that convent four and twenty groats  
and give that friar a penny  and let him go  
nay  nay  thomas  it may no thing be so  
what is a farthing worth parted on twelve  
lo  each thing that is oned in himselve made one  united 
is more strong than when it is y scatter d  
thomas  of me thou shalt not be y flatter d  
thou wouldest have our labour all for nought  
the highe god  that all this world hath wrought  
saith  that the workman worthy is his hire 
thomas  nought of your treasure i desire 
as for myself  but that all our convent 
to pray for you is aye so diligent  
and for to builde christe s owen church  
thomas  if ye will learne for to wirch  
of building up of churches may ye find 
if it be good  in thomas  life of ind  
ye lie here full of anger and of ire  
with which the devil sets your heart on fire  
and chide here this holy innocent 
your wife  that is so meek and patient  
and therefore trow me  thomas  if thee lest  
ne strive not with thy wife  as for the best  
and bear this word away now  by thy faith  
touching such thing  lo  what the wise man saith  
 within thy house be thou no lion  
to thy subjects do none oppression  
nor make thou thine acquaintance for to flee   
and yet  thomas  eftsoones charge i thee  
beware from ire that in thy bosom sleeps  
ware from the serpent  that so slily creeps 
under the grass  and stingeth subtilly  
beware  my son  and hearken patiently  
that twenty thousand men have lost their lives 
for striving with their lemans and their wives  
now since ye have so holy and meek a wife  
what needeth you  thomas  to make strife  
there is  y wis  no serpent so cruel  
when men tread on his tail nor half so fell  
as woman is  when she hath caught an ire  
very vengeance is then all her desire  
ire is a sin  one of the greate seven  
abominable to the god of heaven  
and to himself it is destruction  
this every lewed vicar and parson 
can say  how ire engenders homicide  
ire is in sooth th  executor of pride  
i could of ire you say so muche sorrow  
my tale shoulde last until to morrow  
and therefore pray i god both day and ight  
an irous man god send him little might  
it is great harm  and certes great pity 
to set an irous man in high degree  
 whilom there was an irous potestate  
as saith senec  that during his estate 
upon a day out rode knightes two  
and  as fortune would that it were so  
the one of them came home  the other not  
anon the knight before the judge is brought  
that saide thus   thou hast thy fellow slain  
for which i doom thee to the death certain   
and to another knight commanded he  
 go  lead him to the death  i charge thee   
and happened  as they went by the way 
toward the place where as he should dey  
the knight came  which men weened had been dead 
then thoughte they it was the beste rede 
to lead them both unto the judge again  
they saide   lord  the knight hath not y slain 
his fellow  here he standeth whole alive   
 ye shall be dead   quoth he   so may i thrive  
that is to say  both one  and two  and three   
and to the firste knight right thus spake he  
 i damned thee  thou must algate be dead  
and thou also must needes lose thine head  
for thou the cause art why thy fellow dieth   
and to the thirde knight right thus he sayeth  
 thou hast not done that i commanded thee   
and thus he did do slay them alle three  
irous cambyses was eke dronkelew  
and aye delighted him to be a shrew  
and so befell  a lord of his meinie  
that loved virtuous morality  
said on a day betwixt them two right thus  
 a lord is lost  if he be vicious  
 an irous man is like a frantic beast  
in which there is of wisdom none arrest  
and drunkenness is eke a foul record 
of any man  and namely of a lord  
there is full many an eye and many an ear 
awaiting on a lord  he knows not where  
for godde s love  drink more attemperly  
wine maketh man to lose wretchedly 
his mind  and eke his limbes every one   
 the reverse shalt thou see   quoth he   anon  
and prove it by thine own experience  
that wine doth to folk no such offence  
there is no wine bereaveth me my might 
of hand  nor foot  nor of mine eyen sight   
and for despite he dranke muche more 
a hundred part than he had done before  
and right anon this cursed irous wretch 
this knighte s sone let before him fetch  
commanding him he should before him stand  
and suddenly he took his bow in hand  
and up the string he pulled to his ear  
and with an arrow slew the child right there  
 now whether have i a sicker hand or non   
quoth he   is all my might and mind agone  
hath wine bereaved me mine eyen sight   
why should i tell the answer of the knight  
his son was slain  there is no more to say  
beware therefore with lordes how ye play  
sing placebo  and i shall if i can  
but if it be unto a poore man  
to a poor man men should his vices tell  
but not t  a lord  though he should go to hell  
lo  irous cyrus  thilke persian  
how he destroy d the river of gisen  
for that a horse of his was drowned therein  
when that he wente babylon to win  
he made that the river was so small  
that women mighte wade it over all  
lo  what said he  that so well teache can  
 be thou no fellow to an irous man  
nor with no wood man walke by the way  
lest thee repent   i will no farther say  
 now  thomas  leve brother  leave thine ire  
thou shalt me find as just as is as squire  
hold not the devil s knife aye at thine heaat  
thine anger doth thee all too sore smart  
but shew to me all thy confession   
 nay   quoth the sicke man   by saint simon 
i have been shriven this day of my curate  
i have him told all wholly mine estate  
needeth no more to speak of it  saith he  
but if me list of mine humility   
 give me then of thy good to make our cloister   
quoth he   for many a mussel and many an oyster  
when other men have been full well at ease  
hath been our food  our cloister for to rese  
and yet  god wot  unneth the foundement 
performed is  nor of our pavement 
is not a tile yet within our wones  
by god  we owe forty pound for stones  
now help  thomas  for him that harrow d hell  
for elles must we oure bookes sell  
and if ye lack our predication  
then goes this world all to destruction  
for whoso from this world would us bereave  
so god me save  thomas  by your leave  
he would bereave out of this world the sun 
for who can teach and worken as we conne  
and that is not of little time quoth he  
but since elijah was  and elisee  
have friars been  that find i of record  
in charity  y thanked be our lord  
now  thomas  help for sainte charity   
and down anon he set him on his knee  
the sick man waxed well nigh wood for ire  
he woulde that the friar had been a fire 
with his false dissimulation  
 such thing as is in my possession   
quoth he   that may i give you and none other  
ye say me thus  how that i am your brother   
 yea  certes   quoth this friar   yea  truste well  
i took our dame the letter of our seal  
 now well   quoth he   and somewhat shall i give 
unto your holy convent while i live  
and in thine hand thou shalt it have anon  
on this condition  and other none  
that thou depart it so  my deare brother  
that every friar have as much as other  
this shalt thou swear on thy profession  
withoute fraud or cavillation   
 i swear it   quoth the friar   upon my faith   
and therewithal his hand in his he lay th  
 lo here my faith  in me shall be no lack   
 then put thine hand adown right by my back   
saide this man   and grope well behind  
beneath my buttock  there thou shalt find 
a thing  that i have hid in privity   
 ah   thought this friar   that shall go with me   
and down his hand he launched to the clift  
in hope for to finde there a gift  
and when this sicke man felte this frere 
about his taile groping there and here  
amid his hand he let the friar a fart  
there is no capel drawing in a cart  
that might have let a fart of such a soun   
the friar up start  as doth a wood lioun  
 ah  false churl   quoth he   for godde s bones  
this hast thou in despite done for the nones  
thou shalt abie this fart  if that i may   
his meinie  which that heard of this affray  
came leaping in  and chased out the frere  
and forth he went with a full angry cheer 
and fetch d his fellow  there as lay his store  
he looked as it were a wilde boar  
and grounde with his teeth  so was he wroth  
a sturdy pace down to the court he go th  
where as there wonn d a man of great honour  
to whom that he was always confessour  
this worthy man was lord of that village  
this friar came  as he were in a rage  
where as this lord sat eating at his board  
unnethes might the friar speak one word  
till at the last he saide   god you see   
this lord gan look  and said   ben dicite  
what  friar john  what manner world is this  
i see well that there something is amiss  
ye look as though the wood were full of thieves  
sit down anon  and tell me what your grieve is  
and it shall be amended  if i may   
 i have   quoth he   had a despite to day  
god yielde you  adown in your village  you 
that in this world is none so poor a page  
that would not have abominatioun 
of that i have received in your town  
and yet ne grieveth me nothing so sore  
as that the olde churl  with lockes hoar  
blasphemed hath our holy convent eke   
 now  master   quoth this lord   i you beseek    
 no master  sir   quoth he   but servitour  
though i have had in schoole that honour  
god liketh not  that men us rabbi call 
neither in market  nor in your large hall   
 no force   quoth he   but tell me all your grief   
sir   quoth this friar   an odious mischief 
this day betid is to mine order and me  
and so par consequence to each degree 
of holy churche  god amend it soon   
 sir   quoth the lord   ye know what is to doon  
distemp r you not  ye be my confessour  
ye be the salt of th  earth  and the savour  
for godde s love your patience now hold  
tell me your grief   and he anon him told 
as ye have heard before  ye know well what  
the lady of the house aye stiller sat  
till she had hearde what the friar said  
 hey  godde s mother   quoth she   blissful maid  
is there ought elles  tell me faithfully   
 madame   quoth he   how thinketh you thereby   
 how thinketh me   quoth she   so god me speed  
i say  a churl hath done a churlish deed  
what should i say  god let him never the  
his sicke head is full of vanity  
i hold him in a manner phrenesy   
 madame   quoth he   by god  i shall not lie  
but i in other wise may be awreke  
i shall defame him ov r all there i speak  
this false blasphemour  that charged me 
to parte that will not departed be  
to every man alike  with mischance   
the lord sat still  as he were in a trance  
and in his heart he rolled up and down  
 how had this churl imaginatioun 
to shewe such a problem to the frere  
never ere now heard i of such mattere  
i trow the devil put it in his mind  
in all arsmetrik shall there no man find  
before this day  of such a question  
who shoulde make a demonstration  
that every man should have alike his part 
as of the sound and savour of a fart  
o nice proude churl  i shrew his face  
lo  sires   quoth the lord   with harde grace  
who ever heard of such a thing ere now  
to every man alike  tell me how  
it is impossible  it may not be  
hey nice churl  god let him never the  
the rumbling of a fart  and every soun   
is but of air reverberatioun  
and ever wasteth lite and lite away  
there is no man can deemen  by my fay  
if that it were departed equally  
what  lo  my churl  lo yet how shrewedly 
unto my confessour to day he spake  
i hold him certain a demoniac  
now eat your meat  and let the churl go play  
let him go hang himself a devil way   
now stood the lorde s squier at the board  
that carv d his meat  and hearde word by word 
of all this thing  which that i have you said  
 my lord   quoth he   be ye not paid  
i coulde telle  for a gowne cloth  
to you  sir friar  so that ye be not wrot  
how that this fart should even dealed be 
among your convent  if it liked thee   
 tell   quoth the lord   and thou shalt have anon 
a gowne cloth  by god and by saint john   
 my lord   quoth he   when that the weather is fair  
withoute wind  or perturbing of air  
let bring a cart wheel here into this hall  cause 
but looke that it have its spokes all  
twelve spokes hath a cart wheel commonly  
and bring me then twelve friars  know ye why  
for thirteen is a convent as i guess  
your confessor here  for his worthiness  
shall perform up the number of his convent  
then shall they kneel adown by one assent  
and to each spoke s end  in this mannere  
full sadly lay his nose shall a frere  fully  steadily 
your noble confessor there  god him save  
shall hold his nose upright under the nave  
then shall this churl  with belly stiff and tought 
as any tabour  hither be y brought  
and set him on the wheel right of this cart 
upon the nave  and make him let a fart  
and ye shall see  on peril of my life  
by very proof that is demonstrative  
that equally the sound of it will wend  
and eke the stink  unto the spokes  end  
save that this worthy man  your confessour  
because he is a man of great honour  
shall have the firste fruit  as reason is  
the noble usage of friars yet it is  
the worthy men of them shall first be served  
and certainly he hath it well deserved  
he hath to day taught us so muche good 
with preaching in the pulpit where he stood  
that i may vouchesafe  i say for me  
he had the firste smell of fartes three  
and so would all his brethren hardily  
he beareth him so fair and holily   
the lord  the lady  and each man  save the frere  
saide  that jankin spake in this mattere 
as well as euclid  or as ptolemy  
touching the churl  they said that subtilty 
and high wit made him speaken as he spake  
he is no fool  nor no demoniac  
and jankin hath y won a newe gown  
my tale is done  we are almost at town  
 
the clerk s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
 sir clerk of oxenford   our hoste said  
 ye ride as still and coy  as doth a maid 
that were new spoused  sitting at the board  
this day i heard not of your tongue a word  
i trow ye study about some sophime  
but solomon saith  every thing hath time  
for godde s sake  be of cheer  
it is no time for to study here  
tell us some merry tale  by your fay  
for what man that is entered in a play  
he needes must unto that play assent  
but preache not  as friars do in lent  
to make us for our olde sinnes weep  
nor that thy tale make us not to sleep  
tell us some merry thing of aventures  
your terms  your coloures  and your figures  
keep them in store  till so be ye indite 
high style  as when that men to kinges write  
speake so plain at this time  i you pray  
that we may understande what ye say   
this worthy clerk benignely answer d  
 hoste   quoth he   i am under your yerd  
ye have of us as now the governance  
and therefore would i do you obeisance  
as far as reason asketh  hardily  
i will you tell a tale  which that i 
learn d at padova of a worthy clerk  
as proved by his wordes and his werk  
he is now dead  and nailed in his chest  
i pray to god to give his soul good rest  
francis petrarc   the laureate poet  
highte this clerk  whose rhetoric so sweet 
illumin d all itale of poetry  
as linian did of philosophy  
or law  or other art particulere  
but death  that will not suffer us dwell here 
but as it were a twinkling of an eye  
them both hath slain  and alle we shall die  
 but forth to tellen of this worthy man  
that taughte me this tale  as i began  
i say that first he with high style inditeth 
ere he the body of his tale writeth 
a proem  in the which describeth he 
piedmont  and of saluces the country  
and speaketh of the pennine hilles high  
that be the bounds of all west lombardy  
and of mount vesulus in special  
where as the po out of a welle small 
taketh his firste springing and his source  
that eastward aye increaseth in his course 
t emilia ward  to ferraro  and venice  
the which a long thing were to devise  
and truely  as to my judgement  
me thinketh it a thing impertinent  
save that he would conveye his mattere  
but this is the tale  which that ye shall hear   
 
the tale  
 
pars prima  
 
there is  right at the west side of itale  
down at the root of vesulus the cold  
a lusty plain  abundant of vitaille  
there many a town and tow r thou may st behold  
that founded were in time of fathers old  
and many another delectable sight  
and saluces this noble country hight  
a marquis whilom lord was of that land  
as were his worthy elders him before  
and obedient  aye ready to his hand  
were all his lieges  bothe less and more  
thus in delight he liv d  and had done yore  
belov d and drad  through favour of fortune  
both of his lordes and of his commune  
therewith he was  to speak of lineage  
the gentilest y born of lombardy  
a fair person  and strong  and young of age  
and full of honour and of courtesy  
discreet enough his country for to gie  
saving in some things that he was to blame  
and walter was this younge lordes name  
i blame him thus  that he consider d not 
in time coming what might him betide  
but on his present lust was all his thought  
and for to hawk and hunt on every side  
well nigh all other cares let he slide  
and eke he would that was the worst of all 
wedde no wife for aught that might befall  
only that point his people bare so sore  
that flockmel on a day to him they went  
and one of them  that wisest was of lore 
or elles that the lord would best assent 
that he should tell him what the people meant  
or elles could he well shew such mattere  
he to the marquis said as ye shall hear  
 o noble marquis  your humanity 
assureth us and gives us hardiness  
as oft as time is of necessity  
that we to you may tell our heaviness  
accepte  lord  now of your gentleness  
what we with piteous heart unto you plain  
and let your ears my voice not disdain  
 all have i nought to do in this mattere 
more than another man hath in this place  
yet forasmuch as ye  my lord so dear  
have always shewed me favour and grace  
i dare the better ask of you a space 
of audience  to shewen our request  
and ye  my lord  to do right as you lest  
 for certes  lord  so well us like you 
and all your work  and ev r have done  that we 
ne coulde not ourselves devise how 
we mighte live in more felicity  
save one thing  lord  if that your will it be  
that for to be a wedded man you lest  
then were your people in sovereign hearte s rest  
 bowe your neck under the blissful yoke 
of sovereignty  and not of service  
which that men call espousal or wedlock  
and thinke  lord  among your thoughtes wise  
how that our dayes pass in sundry wise  
for though we sleep  or wake  or roam  or ride  
aye fleeth time  it will no man abide  
 and though your greene youthe flow r as yet  
in creepeth age always as still as stone  
and death menaceth every age  and smit 
in each estate  for there escapeth none  
and all so certain as we know each one 
that we shall die  as uncertain we all 
be of that day when death shall on us fall  
 accepte then of us the true intent  
that never yet refused youre hest  
and we will  lord  if that ye will assent  
choose you a wife  in short time at the lest  
born of the gentilest and of the best 
of all this land  so that it ought to seem 
honour to god and you  as we can deem  
 deliver us out of all this busy dread  
and take a wife  for highe godde s sake  
for if it so befell  as god forbid  
that through your death your lineage should slake  
and that a strange successor shoulde take 
your heritage  oh  woe were us on live  
wherefore we pray you hastily to wive   
their meeke prayer and their piteous cheer 
made the marquis for to have pity  
 ye will   quoth he   mine owen people dear  
to that i ne er ere thought constraine me  
i me rejoiced of my liberty  
that seldom time is found in rnarriage  
where i was free  i must be in servage  
 but natheless i see your true intent  
and trust upon your wit  and have done aye  
wherefore of my free will i will assent 
to wedde me  as soon as e er i may  
but whereas ye have proffer d me to day 
to choose me a wife  i you release 
that choice  and pray you of that proffer cease  
 for god it wot  that children often been 
unlike their worthy elders them before  
bounte comes all of god  not of the strene 
of which they be engender d and y bore  
i trust in godde s bounte  and therefore 
my marriage  and mine estate and rest  
i him betake  he may do as him lest  
 let me alone in choosing of my wife  
that charge upon my back i will endure  
but i you pray  and charge upon your life  
that what wife that i take  ye me assure 
to worship her  while that her life may dure  
in word and work both here and elleswhere  
as she an emperore s daughter were  
 and farthermore this shall ye swear  that ye 
against my choice shall never grudge nor strive  
for since i shall forego my liberty 
at your request  as ever may i thrive  
where as mine heart is set  there will i live 
and but ye will assent in such mannere  
i pray you speak no more of this mattere   
with heartly will they sworen and assent 
to all this thing  there said not one wight nay  
beseeching him of grace  ere that they went  
that he would grante them a certain day 
of his espousal  soon as e er he rnay  
for yet always the people somewhat dread 
lest that the marquis woulde no wife wed  
he granted them a day  such as him lest  
on which he would be wedded sickerly  
and said he did all this at their request  
and they with humble heart full buxomly  
kneeling upon their knees full reverently  
him thanked all  and thus they have an end 
of their intent  and home again they wend  
and hereupon he to his officers 
commanded for the feaste to purvey  
and to his privy knightes and squiers 
such charge he gave  as him list on them lay  
and they to his commandement obey  
and each of them doth all his diligence 
to do unto the feast all reverence  
 
pars secunda 
 
not far from thilke palace honourable  
where as this marquis shope his marriage  
there stood a thorp  of sighte delectable  
in which the poore folk of that village 
hadde their beastes and their harbourage  
and of their labour took their sustenance  
after the earthe gave them abundance  
among this poore folk there dwelt a man 
which that was holden poorest of them all  
but highe god sometimes sende can 
his grace unto a little ox s stall  
janicola men of that thorp him call  
a daughter had he  fair enough to sight  
and griseldis this younge maiden hight  
but for to speak of virtuous beauty  
then was she one the fairest under sun  
full poorely y foster d up was she  
no likerous lust was in her heart y run  
well ofter of the well than of the tun 
she drank  and  for she woulde virtue please 
she knew well labour  but no idle ease  
but though this maiden tender were of age  
yet in the breast of her virginity 
there was inclos d a sad and ripe corage  
and in great reverence and charity spirit 
her olde poore father foster d she  
a few sheep  spinning  on the field she kept  
she woulde not be idle till she slept  
and when she homeward came  she would bring 
wortes  and other herbes  times oft  ts  cabbages 
the which she shred and seeth d for her living  
and made her bed full hard  and nothing soft  
and aye she kept her father s life on loft 
with ev ry obeisance and diligence  
that child may do to father s reverence  
upon griselda  this poor creature  
full often sithes this marquis set his eye  
as he on hunting rode  paraventure  
and when it fell that he might her espy  
he not with wanton looking of folly 
his eyen cast on her  but in sad wise 
upon her cheer he would him oft advise  
commending in his heart her womanhead  
and eke her virtue  passing any wight 
of so young age  as well in cheer as deed  
for though the people have no great insight 
in virtue  he considered full right 
her bounte  and disposed that he would odness 
wed only her  if ever wed he should  
the day of wedding came  but no wight can 
telle what woman that it shoulde be  
for which marvail wonder d many a man  
and saide  when they were in privity  
 will not our lord yet leave his vanity  
will he not wed  alas  alas the while  
why will he thus himself and us beguile   
but natheless this marquis had make 
of gemmes  set in gold and in azure  
brooches and ringes  for griselda s sake  
and of her clothing took he the measure 
of a maiden like unto her stature  
and eke of other ornamentes all 
that unto such a wedding shoulde fall  
the time of undern of the same day evening 
approached  that this wedding shoulde be  
and all the palace put was in array  
both hall and chamber  each in its degree  
houses of office stuffed with plenty 
there may st thou see of dainteous vitaille  
that may be found  as far as lasts itale  
this royal marquis  richely array d  
lordes and ladies in his company  
the which unto the feaste were pray d  
and of his retinue the bach lery  
with many a sound of sundry melody  
unto the village  of the which i told  
in this array the right way did they hold  
griseld  of this god wot full innocent  
that for her shapen was all this array  
to fetche water at a well is went  
and home she came as soon as e er she may  
for well she had heard say  that on that day 
the marquis shoulde wed  and  if she might  
she fain would have seen somewhat of that sight  
she thought   i will with other maidens stand  
that be my fellows  in our door  and see 
the marchioness  and therefore will i fand 
to do at home  as soon as it may be  
the labour which belongeth unto me  
and then i may at leisure her behold  
if she this way unto the castle hold   
and as she would over the threshold gon  
the marquis came and gan for her to call  
and she set down her water pot anon 
beside the threshold  in an ox s stall  
and down upon her knees she gan to fall  
and with sad countenance kneeled still  
till she had heard what was the lorde s will  
the thoughtful marquis spake unto the maid 
full soberly  and said in this mannere  
 where is your father  griseldis   he said  
and she with reverence  in humble cheer  
answered   lord  he is all ready here   
and in she went withoute longer let delay 
and to the marquis she her father fet  
he by the hand then took the poore man  
and saide thus  when he him had aside  
 janicola  i neither may nor can 
longer the pleasance of mine hearte hide  
if that thou vouchesafe  whatso betide  
thy daughter will i take  ere that i wend  
as for my wife  unto her life s end  
 thou lovest me  that know i well certain  
and art my faithful liegeman y bore  born 
and all that liketh me  i dare well sayn 
it liketh thee  and specially therefore 
tell me that point  that i have said before    
if that thou wilt unto this purpose draw  
to take me as for thy son in law   
this sudden case the man astonied so  
that red he wax d  abash d  and all quaking 
he stood  unnethes said he wordes mo   
but only thus   lord   quoth he   my willing 
is as ye will  nor against your liking 
i will no thing  mine owen lord so dear  
right as you list governe this mattere   
 then will i   quoth the marquis softely  
 that in thy chamber i  and thou  and she  
have a collation  and know st thou why  
for i will ask her  if her will it be 
to be my wife  and rule her after me  
and all this shall be done in thy presence  
i will not speak out of thine audience   
and in the chamber while they were about 
the treaty  which ye shall hereafter hear  
the people came into the house without  
and wonder d them in how honest mannere 
and tenderly she kept her father dear  
but utterly griseldis wonder might  
for never erst ne saw she such a sight  
no wonder is though that she be astoned  
to see so great a guest come in that place  
she never was to no such guestes woned  
for which she looked with full pale face  
but shortly forth this matter for to chase  
these are the wordes that the marquis said 
to this benigne  very  faithful maid  
 griseld    he said   ye shall well understand  
it liketh to your father and to me 
that i you wed  and eke it may so stand  
as i suppose ye will that it so be  
but these demandes ask i first   quoth he  
 since that it shall be done in hasty wise  
will ye assent  or elles you advise  
 i say this  be ye ready with good heart 
to all my lust  and that i freely may  
as me best thinketh  you laugh or smart  
and never ye to grudge  night nor day  
and eke when i say yea  ye say not nay  
neither by word  nor frowning countenance  
swear this  and here i swear our alliance   
wond ring upon this word  quaking for dread  
she saide   lord  indigne and unworthy 
am i to this honour that ye me bede  
but as ye will yourself  right so will i  
and here i swear  that never willingly 
in word or thought i will you disobey  
for to be dead  though me were loth to dey   
 this is enough  griselda mine   quoth he  
and forth he went with a full sober cheer  
out at the door  and after then came she  
and to the people he said in this mannere  
 this is my wife   quoth he   that standeth here  
honoure her  and love her  i you pray  
whoso me loves  there is no more to say   
and  for that nothing of her olde gear 
she shoulde bring into his house  he bade 
that women should despoile her right there  
of which these ladies were nothing glad 
to handle her clothes wherein she was clad  
but natheless this maiden bright of hue 
from foot to head they clothed have all new  
her haires have they comb d that lay untress d 
full rudely  and with their fingers small 
a crown upon her head they have dress d  
and set her full of nouches great and small  
of her array why should i make a tale  
unneth the people her knew for her fairness  
when she transmuted was in such richess  
the marquis hath her spoused with a ring 
brought for the same cause  and then her set 
upon a horse snow white  and well ambling  
and to his palace  ere he longer let delayed 
with joyful people  that her led and met  
conveyed her  and thus the day they spend 
in revel  till the sunne gan descend  
and  shortly forth this tale for to chase  
i say  that to this newe marchioness 
god hath such favour sent her of his grace  
that it ne seemed not by likeliness 
that she was born and fed in rudeness    
as in a cot  or in an ox s stall    
but nourish d in an emperore s hall  
to every wight she waxen is so dear grown 
and worshipful  that folk where she was born  
that from her birthe knew her year by year  
unnethes trowed they  but durst have sworn  
that to janicol  of whom i spake before  
she was not daughter  for by conjecture 
them thought she was another creature  
for though that ever virtuous was she  
she was increased in such excellence 
of thewes good  y set in high bounte  
and so discreet  and fair of eloquence  
so benign  and so digne of reverence  
and coulde so the people s heart embrace  
that each her lov d that looked on her face  
not only of saluces in the town 
published was the bounte of her name  
but eke besides in many a regioun  
if one said well  another said the same  
so spread of here high bounte the fame  
that men and women  young as well as old  
went to saluces  her for to behold  
thus walter lowly    nay  but royally   
wedded with fortn ate honestete  
in godde s peace lived full easily 
at home  and outward grace enough had he  
and  for he saw that under low degree 
was honest virtue hid  the people him held 
a prudent man  and that is seen full seld   
not only this griseldis through her wit 
couth all the feat of wifely homeliness  
but eke  when that the case required it  
the common profit coulde she redress  
there n as discord  rancour  nor heaviness 
in all the land  that she could not appease  
and wisely bring them all in rest and ease 
though that her husband absent were or non  
if gentlemen or other of that country  
were wroth  she woulde bringe them at one  
so wise and ripe wordes hadde she  
and judgement of so great equity  
that she from heaven sent was  as men wend  
people to save  and every wrong t amend 
not longe time after that this griseld  
was wedded  she a daughter had y bore  
all she had lever borne a knave child  
glad was the marquis and his folk therefore  
for  though a maiden child came all before  
she may unto a knave child attain 
by likelihood  since she is not barren  
 
pars tertia  
 
there fell  as falleth many times mo   
when that his child had sucked but a throw  little while 
this marquis in his hearte longed so 
to tempt his wife  her sadness for to know  
that he might not out of his hearte throw 
this marvellous desire his wife t asssay  
needless  god wot  he thought her to affray  
 
he had assayed her anough before  
and found her ever good  what needed it 
her for to tempt  and always more and more  
though some men praise it for a subtle wit  
but as for me  i say that it sit 
t assay a wife when that it is no need  
and putte her in anguish and in dread  
for which this marquis wrought in this mannere  
he came at night alone there as she lay  
with sterne face and with full troubled cheer  
and saide thus   griseld    quoth he  that day 
that i you took out of your poor array  
and put you in estate of high nobless  
ye have it not forgotten  as i guess  
 i say  griseld   this present dignity  
in which that i have put you  as i trow 
maketh you not forgetful for to be 
that i you took in poor estate full low  
for any weal you must yourselfe know  
take heed of every word that i you say  
there is no wight that hears it but we tway  
 ye know yourself well how that ye came here 
into this house  it is not long ago  
and though to me ye be right lefe and dear  
unto my gentles ye be nothing so  nobles  gentlefolk 
they say  to them it is great shame and woe 
for to be subject  and be in servage  
to thee  that born art of small lineage  
 and namely since thy daughter was y bore 
these wordes have they spoken doubteless  
but i desire  as i have done before  
to live my life with them in rest and peace  
i may not in this case be reckeless  
i must do with thy daughter for the best  
not as i would  but as my gentles lest  
 and yet  god wot  this is full loth to me  
but natheless withoute your weeting 
i will nought do  but this will i   quoth he  
 that ye to me assenten in this thing  
shew now your patience in your working  
that ye me hight and swore in your village 
the day that maked was our marriage   
when she had heard all this  she not amev d 
neither in word  in cheer  nor countenance 
for  as it seemed  she was not aggriev d  
she saide   lord  all lies in your pleasance  
my child and i  with hearty obeisance 
be youres all  and ye may save or spill 
your owen thing  work then after your will  
 there may no thing  so god my soule save  
like to you  that may displease me  
nor i desire nothing for to have  
nor dreade for to lose  save only ye  
this will is in mine heart  and aye shall be  
no length of time  nor death  may this deface  
nor change my corage to another place   
glad was the marquis for her answering  
but yet he feigned as he were not so  
all dreary was his cheer and his looking 
when that he should out of the chamber go  
soon after this  a furlong way or two  
he privily hath told all his intent 
unto a man  and to his wife him sent  
a manner sergeant was this private man  
the which he faithful often founden had 
in thinges great  and eke such folk well can 
do execution in thinges bad  
the lord knew well  that he him loved and drad  
and when this sergeant knew his lorde s will  
into the chamber stalked he full still  
 madam   he said   ye must forgive it me  
though i do thing to which i am constrain d  
ye be so wise  that right well knowe ye 
that lordes  hestes may not be y feign d  
they may well be bewailed and complain d  
but men must needs unto their lust obey  
and so will i  there is no more to say  
 this child i am commanded for to take   
and spake no more  but out the child he hent 
dispiteously  and gan a cheer to make 
as though he would have slain it ere he went  
griseldis must all suffer and consent  
and as a lamb she sat there meek and still  
and let this cruel sergeant do his will 
suspicious was the diffame of this man  
suspect his face  suspect his word also  
suspect the time in which he this began  
alas  her daughter  that she loved so  
she weened he would have it slain right tho  
but natheless she neither wept nor siked  
conforming her to what the marquis liked  
but at the last to speake she began  
and meekly she unto the sergeant pray d  
so as he was a worthy gentle man  
that she might kiss her child  ere that it died  
and in her barme this little child she laid  
with full sad face  and gan the child to bless  
and lulled it  and after gan it kiss  
and thus she said in her benigne voice  
farewell  my child  i shall thee never see  
but since i have thee marked with the cross  
of that father y blessed may st thou be 
that for us died upon a cross of tree  
thy soul  my little child  i him betake  
for this night shalt thou dien for my sake  
i trow that to a norice in this case 
it had been hard this ruthe for to see  
well might a mother then have cried   alas   
but natheless so sad steadfast was she  
that she endured all adversity  
and to the sergeant meekely she said  
 have here again your little younge maid  
 go now   quoth she   and do my lord s behest  
and one thing would i pray you of your grace  
but if my lord forbade you at the least  
bury this little body in some place  
that neither beasts nor birdes it arace   
but he no word would to that purpose say  
but took the child and went upon his way  
the sergeant came unto his lord again  
and of griselda s words and of her cheer 
he told him point for point  in short and plain  
and him presented with his daughter dear  
somewhat this lord had ruth in his mannere  
but natheless his purpose held he still  
as lordes do  when they will have their will  
and bade this sergeant that he privily 
shoulde the child full softly wind and wrap  
with alle circumstances tenderly  
and carry it in a coffer  or in lap  
but  upon pain his head off for to swap  
that no man shoulde know of his intent  
nor whence he came  nor whither that he went  
but at bologna  to his sister dear  
that at that time of panic  was countess  
he should it take  and shew her this mattere  
beseeching her to do her business 
this child to foster in all gentleness  
and whose child it was he bade her hide 
from every wight  for aught that might betide  
the sergeant went  and hath fulfill d this thing  
but to the marquis now returne we  
for now went he full fast imagining 
if by his wife s cheer he mighte see  
or by her wordes apperceive  that she 
were changed  but he never could her find  
but ever in one alike sad and kind  
as glad  as humble  as busy in service  
and eke in love  as she was wont to be  
was she to him  in every manner wise  
and of her daughter not a word spake she  
no accident for no adversity 
was seen in her  nor e er her daughter s name from her affliction 
she named  or in earnest or in game  
 
pars quarta 
 
in this estate there passed be four year 
ere she with childe was  but  as god wo ld  
a knave child she bare by this waltere  
full gracious and fair for to behold  
and when that folk it to his father told  
not only he  but all his country  merry 
were for this child  and god they thank and hery  
when it was two year old  and from the breast 
departed of the norice  on a day n  weaned 
this marquis caughte yet another lest 
to tempt his wife yet farther  if he may  
oh  needless was she tempted in as say  
but wedded men connen no measure  
when that they find a patient creature  
 wife   quoth the marquis   ye have heard ere this 
my people sickly bear our marriage  
and namely since my son y boren is  
now is it worse than ever in all our age  
the murmur slays mine heart and my corage  
for to mine ears cometh the voice so smart  
that it well nigh destroyed hath mine heart  
 now say they thus   when walter is y gone  
then shall the blood of janicol  succeed  
and be our lord  for other have we none   
such wordes say my people  out of drede  
well ought i of such murmur take heed  
for certainly i dread all such sentence  
though they not plainen in mine audience  
 i woulde live in peace  if that i might  
wherefore i am disposed utterly  
as i his sister served ere by night  
right so think i to serve him privily  
this warn i you  that ye not suddenly 
out of yourself for no woe should outraie  
be patient  and thereof i you pray   
 i have   quoth she   said thus  and ever shall  
i will no thing  nor n ill no thing  certain  
but as you list  not grieveth me at all 
though that my daughter and my son be slain 
at your commandement  that is to sayn  
i have not had no part of children twain  
but first sickness  and after woe and pain  
 ye be my lord  do with your owen thing 
right as you list  and ask no rede of me  
for  as i left at home all my clothing 
when i came first to you  right so   quoth she  
 left i my will and all my liberty  
and took your clothing  wherefore i you pray  
do your pleasance  i will your lust obey  
 and  certes  if i hadde prescience 
your will to know  ere ye your lust me told  
i would it do withoute negligence  
but  now i know your lust  and what ye wo ld  
all your pleasance firm and stable i hold  
for  wist i that my death might do you ease  
right gladly would i dien you to please  
 death may not make no comparisoun 
unto your love   and when this marquis say 
the constance of his wife  he cast adown 
his eyen two  and wonder d how she may 
in patience suffer all this array  
and forth he went with dreary countenance  
but to his heart it was full great pleasance  
this ugly sergeant  in the same wise 
that he her daughter caught  right so hath he 
or worse  if men can any worse devise  
y hent her son  that full was of beauty  
and ever in one so patient was she  
that she no cheere made of heaviness  
but kiss d her son  and after gan him bless  
save this she prayed him  if that he might  
her little son he would in earthe grave  
his tender limbes  delicate to sight  
from fowles and from beastes for to save  
but she none answer of him mighte have  
he went his way  as him nothing ne raught  
but to bologna tenderly it brought  
the marquis wonder d ever longer more 
upon her patience  and  if that he 
not hadde soothly knowen therebefore 
that perfectly her children loved she  
he would have ween d that of some subtilty  
and of malice  or for cruel corage  
she hadde suffer d this with sad visage  
but well he knew  that  next himself  certain 
she lov d her children best in every wise  
but now of women would i aske fain  
if these assayes mighte not suffice  
what could a sturdy husband more devise 
to prove her wifehood and her steadfastness  
and he continuing ev r in sturdiness  
but there be folk of such condition  
that  when they have a certain purpose take  
thiey cannot stint of their intention  
but  right as they were bound unto a stake  
they will not of their firste purpose slake  
right so this marquis fully hath purpos d 
to tempt his wife  as he was first dispos d  
he waited  if by word or countenance 
that she to him was changed of corage  
but never could he finde variance  
she was aye one in heart and in visage  
and aye the farther that she was in age  
the more true if that it were possible 
she was to him in love  and more penible  
for which it seemed thus  that of them two 
there was but one will  for  as walter lest  
the same pleasance was her lust also  
and  god be thanked  all fell for the best  
she shewed well  for no worldly unrest  
a wife as of herself no thinge should 
will  in effect  but as her husbaud would  
the sland r of walter wondrous wide sprad  
that of a cruel heart he wickedly  
for he a poore woman wedded had  
had murder d both his children privily  
such murmur was among them commonly  
no wonder is  for to the people s ear 
there came no word  but that they murder d were  
for which  whereas his people therebefore 
had lov d him well  the sland r of his diffame 
made them that they him hated therefore  
to be a murd rer is a hateful name  
but natheless  for earnest or for game  
he of his cruel purpose would not stent  
to tempt his wife was set all his intent  
when that his daughter twelve year was of age  
he to the court of rome  in subtle wise 
informed of his will  sent his message  
commanding him such bulles to devise 
as to his cruel purpose may suffice  
how that the pope  for his people s rest  
bade him to wed another  if him lest  
i say he bade they shoulde counterfeit 
the pope s bulles  making mention 
that he had leave his firste wife to lete  
to stinte rancour and dissension 
betwixt his people and him  thus spake the bull  
the which they have published at full  
the rude people  as no wonder is  
weened full well that it had been right so  
but  when these tidings came to griseldis  
i deeme that her heart was full of woe  
but she  alike sad for evermo   
disposed was  this humble creature  
th  adversity of fortune all t  endure  
abiding ever his lust and his pleasance  
to whom that she was given  heart and all  
as to her very worldly suffisance  
but  shortly if this story tell i shall  
the marquis written hath in special 
a letter  in which he shewed his intent  
and secretly it to bologna sent  
to th  earl of panico  which hadde tho 
wedded his sister  pray d he specially 
to bringe home again his children two 
in honourable estate all openly  
but one thing he him prayed utterly  
that he to no wight  though men would inquere  
shoulde not tell whose children that they were  
but say  the maiden should y wedded be 
unto the marquis of saluce anon  
and as this earl was prayed  so did he  
for  at day set  he on his way is gone 
toward saluce  and lorde s many a one 
in rich array  this maiden for to guide    
her younge brother riding her beside  
arrayed was toward her marriage as if for 
this freshe maiden  full of gemmes clear  
her brother  which that seven year was of age  
arrayed eke full fresh in his mannere  
and thus  in great nobless  and with glad cheer  
toward saluces shaping their journey  
from day to day they rode upon their way  
 
pars quinta  
 
among all this  after his wick  usage  
the marquis  yet his wife to tempte more going on 
to the uttermost proof of her corage  
fully to have experience and lore 
if that she were as steadfast as before  
he on a day  in open audience  
full boisterously said her this sentence  
 certes  griseld   i had enough pleasance 
to have you to my wife  for your goodness  
and for your truth  and for your obeisance  
not for your lineage  nor for your richess  
but now know i  in very soothfastness  
that in great lordship  if i well advise  
there is great servitude in sundry wise  
 i may not do as every ploughman may  
my people me constraineth for to take 
another wife  and cryeth day by day  
and eke the pope  rancour for to slake  
consenteth it  that dare i undertake  
and truely  thus much i will you say  
my newe wife is coming by the way  
 be strong of heart  and void anon her place  
and thilke dower that ye brought to me  
take it again  i grant it of my grace  
returne to your father s house   quoth he  
 no man may always have prosperity  
with even heart i rede you to endure 
the stroke of fortune or of aventure   
and she again answer d in patience  
 my lord   quoth she   i know  and knew alway  
how that betwixte your magnificence 
and my povert  no wight nor can nor may 
make comparison  it is no nay  
i held me never digne in no mannere 
to be your wife  nor yet your chamberere  
 and in this house  where ye me lady made  
the highe god take i for my witness  
and all so wisly he my soule glade  
i never held me lady nor mistress  
but humble servant to your worthiness  
and ever shall  while that my life may dure  
aboven every worldly creature  
 that ye so long  of your benignity  
have holden me in honour and nobley  
where as i was not worthy for to be  
that thank i god and you  to whom i pray 
foryield it you  there is no more to say  
unto my father gladly will i wend  
and with him dwell  unto my lifes end  
 where i was foster d as a child full small  
till i be dead my life there will i lead  
a widow clean in body  heart  and all  
for since i gave to you my maidenhead  
and am your true wife  it is no dread  
god shielde such a lordes wife to take 
another man to husband or to make  
 and of your newe wife  god of his grace 
so grant you weal and all prosperity  
for i will gladly yield to her my place  
in which that i was blissful wont to be  
for since it liketh you  my lord   quoth she  
 that whilom weren all mine hearte s rest  
that i shall go  i will go when you lest  
 but whereas ye me proffer such dowaire 
as i first brought  it is well in my mind  
it was my wretched clothes  nothing fair  
the which to me were hard now for to find  
o goode god  how gentle and how kind 
ye seemed by your speech and your visage  
the day that maked was our marriage  
 but sooth is said    algate i find it true  
for in effect it proved is on me    
love is not old as when that it is new  
but certes  lord  for no adversity  
to dien in this case  it shall not be 
that e er in word or work i shall repent 
that i you gave mine heart in whole intent  
 my lord  ye know that in my father s place 
ye did me strip out of my poore weed  
and richely ye clad me of your grace  
to you brought i nought elles  out of dread  
but faith  and nakedness  and maidenhead  
and here again your clothing i restore  
and eke your wedding ring for evermore  
 the remnant of your jewels ready be 
within your chamber  i dare safely sayn  
naked out of my father s house   quoth she  
 i came  and naked i must turn again  
all your pleasance would i follow fain  
but yet i hope it be not your intent 
that smockless i out of your palace went  
 ye could not do so dishonest a thing  
that thilke womb  in which your children lay  
shoulde before the people  in my walking  
be seen all bare  and therefore i you pray  
let me not like a worm go by the way  
remember you  mine owen lord so dear  
i was your wife  though i unworthy were  
 wherefore  in guerdon of my maidenhead  
which that i brought and not again i bear  
as vouchesafe to give me to my meed 
but such a smock as i was wont to wear  
that i therewith may wrie the womb of her 
that was your wife  and here i take my leave 
of you  mine owen lord  lest i you grieve   
 the smock   quoth he   that thou hast on thy back  
let it be still  and bear it forth with thee   
but well unnethes thilke word he spake  
but went his way for ruth and for pity  
before the folk herselfe stripped she  
and in her smock  with foot and head all bare  
toward her father s house forth is she fare  
the folk her follow d weeping on her way  
and fortune aye they cursed as they gon  
but she from weeping kept her eyen drey  
nor in this time worde spake she none  
her father  that this tiding heard anon  
cursed the day and time  that nature 
shope him to be a living creature  
for  out of doubt  this olde poore man 
was ever in suspect of her marriage  
for ever deem d he  since it first began  
that when the lord fulfill d had his corage  
he woulde think it were a disparage 
to his estate  so low for to alight  
and voide her as soon as e er he might  
against his daughter hastily went he 
for he by noise of folk knew her coming  
and with her olde coat  as it might be  
he cover d her  full sorrowfully weeping  
but on her body might he it not bring  
for rude was the cloth  and more of age 
by dayes fele than at her marriage  
thus with her father for a certain space 
dwelled this flow r of wifely patience  
that neither by her words nor by her face  
before the folk nor eke in their absence  
ne shewed she that her was done offence  
nor of her high estate no remembrance 
ne hadde she  as by her countenance  
no wonder is  for in her great estate 
her ghost was ever in plein humility  
no tender mouth  no hearte delicate  
no pomp  and no semblant of royalty  
but full of patient benignity  
discreet and prideless  aye honourable  
and to her husband ever meek and stable  
men speak of job  and most for his humbless  
as clerkes  when them list  can well indite  
namely of men  but  as in soothfastness  
though clerkes praise women but a lite  
there can no man in humbless him acquite 
as women can  nor can be half so true 
as women be  but it be fall of new  
 
pars sexta 
 
from bologn  is the earl of panic  come  
of which the fame up sprang to more and less  
and to the people s eares all and some 
was know n eke  that a newe marchioness 
he with him brought  in such pomp and richess 
that never was there seen with manne s eye 
so noble array in all west lombardy  
the marquis  which that shope and knew all this  
ere that the earl was come  sent his message 
for thilke poore sely griseldis  
and she  with humble heart and glad visage  
nor with no swelling thought in her corage  
came at his hest  and on her knees her set  
and rev rently and wisely she him gret  
 griseld    quoth he   my will is utterly  
this maiden  that shall wedded be to me  
received be to morrow as royally 
as it possible is in my house to be  
and eke that every wight in his degree 
have his estate in sitting and service  
and in high pleasance  as i can devise  
 i have no women sufficient  certain  
the chambers to array in ordinance 
after my lust  and therefore would i fain 
that thine were all such manner governance  
thou knowest eke of old all my pleasance  
though thine array be bad  and ill besey  
do thou thy devoir at the leaste way   
 
 not only  lord  that i am glad   quoth she  
 to do your lust  but i desire also 
you for to serve and please in my degree  
withoute fainting  and shall evermo   
nor ever for no weal  nor for no woe  
ne shall the ghost within mine hearte stent 
to love you best with all my true intent   
and with that word she gan the house to dight  
and tables for to set  and beds to make  
and pained her to do all that she might  she took pains 
praying the chambereres for godde s sake 
to hasten them  and faste sweep and shake  
and she the most serviceable of all 
hath ev ry chamber arrayed  and his hall  
aboute undern gan the earl alight  
that with him brought these noble children tway  
for which the people ran to see the sight 
of their array  so richely besey  
and then at erst amonges them they say  
that walter was no fool  though that him lest 
to change his wife  for it was for the best  
for she is fairer  as they deemen all  
than is griseld   and more tender of age  
and fairer fruit between them shoulde fall  
and more pleasant  for her high lineage  
her brother eke so fair was of visage  
that them to see the people hath caught pleasance  
commending now the marquis  governance  
 o stormy people  unsad and ev r untrue  
and undiscreet  and changing as a vane  
delighting ev r in rumour that is new  
for like the moon so waxe ye and wane  
aye full of clapping  enough a jane  
your doom is false  your constance evil preveth  
a full great fool is he that you believeth   
thus saide the sad folk in that city  
when that the people gazed up and down  
for they were glad  right for the novelty  
to have a newe lady of their town  
no more of this now make i mentioun  
but to griseld  again i will me dress  
and tell her constancy and business  
full busy was griseld  in ev ry thing 
that to the feaste was appertinent  
right nought was she abash d of her clothing  
though it were rude  and somedeal eke to rent  
but with glad cheer unto the gate she went 
with other folk  to greet the marchioness  
and after that did forth her business  
with so glad cheer his guestes she receiv d 
and so conningly each in his degree  
that no defaulte no man apperceiv d  
but aye they wonder d what she mighte be 
that in so poor array was for to see  
and coude such honour and reverence  
and worthily they praise her prudence  
in all this meane while she not stent 
this maid  and eke her brother  to commend 
with all her heart in full benign intent  
so well  that no man could her praise amend  
but at the last  when that these lordes wend 
to sitte down to meat  he gan to call 
griseld   as she was busy in the hall  
 griseld    quoth he  as it were in his play  
 how liketh thee my wife  and her beauty   
 right well  my lord   quoth she   for  in good fay  
a fairer saw i never none than she  
i pray to god give you prosperity  
and so i hope  that he will to you send 
pleasance enough unto your lives end  
 one thing beseech i you  and warn also  
that ye not pricke with no tormenting 
this tender maiden  as ye have done mo  
for she is foster d in her nourishing 
more tenderly  and  to my supposing  
she mighte not adversity endure 
as could a poore foster d creature   
and when this walter saw her patience  
her gladde cheer  and no malice at all  
and he so often had her done offence  
and she aye sad and constant as a wall  
continuing ev r her innocence o er all  
the sturdy marquis gan his hearte dress 
to rue upon her wifely steadfastness  
 this is enough  griselda mine   quoth he  
 be now no more aghast  nor evil paid  
i have thy faith and thy benignity 
as well as ever woman was  assay d  
in great estate and poorely array d  
now know i  deare wife  thy steadfastness   
and her in arms he took  and gan to kiss  
and she for wonder took of it no keep  
she hearde not what thing he to her said  
she far d as she had start out of a sleep  
till she out of her mazedness abraid  
 griseld    quoth he   by god that for us died  
thou art my wife  none other i have  
nor ever had  as god my soule save  
 this is thy daughter  which thou hast suppos d 
to be my wife  that other faithfully 
shall be mine heir  as i have aye dispos d  
thou bare them of thy body truely  
at bologna kept i them privily  
take them again  for now may st thou not say 
that thou hast lorn none of thy children tway  
 and folk  that otherwise have said of me  
i warn them well  that i have done this deed 
for no malice  nor for no cruelty  
but to assay in thee thy womanhead  
and not to slay my children god forbid  
but for to keep them privily and still  
till i thy purpose knew  and all thy will   
when she this heard  in swoon adown she falleth 
for piteous joy  and after her swooning  
she both her younge children to her calleth  
and in her armes piteously weeping 
embraced them  and tenderly kissing  
full like a mother  with her salte tears 
she bathed both their visage and their hairs  
o  what a piteous thing it was to see 
her swooning  and her humble voice to hear  
 grand mercy  lord  god thank it you   quoth she  
that ye have saved me my children dear  
now reck i never to be dead right here  
since i stand in your love  and in your grace  
no force of death  nor when my spirit pace  
 o tender  o dear  o young children mine  
your woeful mother weened steadfastly 
that cruel houndes  or some foul vermine  
had eaten you  but god of his mercy  
and your benigne father tenderly 
have you keep   and in that same stound 
all suddenly she swapt down to the ground  
 
and in her swoon so sadly holdeth she 
her children two  when she gan them embrace  
that with great sleight and great difficulty 
the children from her arm they can arace  
o  many a tear on many a piteous face 
down ran of them that stoode her beside  
unneth  aboute her might they abide  
walter her gladdeth  and her sorrow slaketh  
she riseth up abashed from her trance  
and every wight her joy and feaste maketh  
till she hath caught again her countenance  
walter her doth so faithfully pleasance  
that it was dainty for to see the cheer 
betwixt them two  since they be met in fere  
the ladies  when that they their time sey  
have taken her  and into chamber gone  
and stripped her out of her rude array  
and in a cloth of gold that brightly shone  
and with a crown of many a riche stone 
upon her head  they into hall her brought  
and there she was honoured as her ought  
thus had this piteous day a blissful end  
for every man and woman did his might 
this day in mirth and revel to dispend  
till on the welkin shone the starres bright  
for more solemn in every mannes sight 
this feaste was  and greater of costage  
than was the revel of her marriage  
full many a year in high prosperity 
lived these two in concord and in rest  
and richely his daughter married he 
unto a lord  one of the worthiest 
of all itale  and then in peace and rest 
his wife s father in his court he kept  
till that the soul out of his body crept  
his son succeeded in his heritage  
in rest and peace  after his father s day  
and fortunate was eke in marriage  
all he put not his wife in great assay  
this world is not so strong  it is no nay  
as it hath been in olde times yore  
and hearken what this author saith  therefore  
this story is said  not for that wives should 
follow griselda in humility  
for it were importable though they would  
but for that every wight in his degree 
shoulde be constant in adversity  
as was griselda  therefore petrarch writeth 
this story  which with high style he inditeth  
for  since a woman was so patient 
unto a mortal man  well more we ought 
receiven all in gree that god us sent  
for great skill is he proved that he wrought  
but he tempteth no man that he hath bought  
as saith saint james  if ye his  pistle read  
he proveth folk all day  it is no dread  
and suffereth us  for our exercise  
with sharpe scourges of adversity 
full often to be beat in sundry wise  
not for to know our will  for certes he  
ere we were born  knew all our frailty  
and for our best is all his governance  
let us then live in virtuous sufferance  
but one word  lordings  hearken  ere i go  
it were full hard to finde now a days 
in all a town griseldas three or two  
for  if that they were put to such assays  
the gold of them hath now so bad allays 
with brass  that though the coin be fair at eye  
it woulde rather break in two than ply  
for which here  for the wife s love of bath    
whose life and all her sex may god maintain 
in high mast ry  and elles were it scath    
i will  with lusty hearte fresh and green  
say you a song to gladden you  i ween  
and let us stint of earnestful mattere  
hearken my song  that saith in this mannere  
l envoy of chaucer  
 
 griseld  is dead  and eke her patience  
and both at once are buried in itale  
for which i cry in open audience  
no wedded man so hardy be t  assail 
his wife s patience  in trust to find 
griselda s  for in certain he shall fail  
 o noble wives  full of high prudence  
let no humility your tongues nail  
nor let no clerk have cause or diligence 
to write of you a story of such marvail  
as of griselda patient and kind  
lest chichevache you swallow in her entrail  
 follow echo  that holdeth no silence  
but ever answereth at the countertail  
be not bedaffed for your innocence  
but sharply take on you the governail  
imprinte well this lesson in your mind  
for common profit  since it may avail  
 ye archiwives  stand aye at defence  
since ye be strong as is a great camail  
nor suffer not that men do you offence  
and slender wives  feeble in battail  
be eager as a tiger yond in ind  
aye clapping as a mill  i you counsail  
 nor dread them not  nor do them reverence  
for though thine husband armed be in mail  
the arrows of thy crabbed eloquence 
shall pierce his breast  and eke his aventail  
in jealousy i rede eke thou him bind  
and thou shalt make him couch as doth a quail  
 if thou be fair  where folk be in presence 
shew thou thy visage and thine apparail  
if thou be foul  be free of thy dispence  
to get thee friendes aye do thy travail  
be aye of cheer as light as leaf on lind  
and let him care  and weep  and wring  and wail   
 
the merchant s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
 weeping and wailing  care and other sorrow  
i have enough  on even and on morrow   
quoth the merchant   and so have other mo   
that wedded be  i trow that it be so  
for well i wot it fareth so by me  
i have a wife  the worste that may be  
for though the fiend to her y coupled were  
she would him overmatch  i dare well swear  
why should i you rehearse in special 
her high malice  she is a shrew at all  
there is a long and large difference everything wicked 
betwixt griselda s greate patience  
and of my wife the passing cruelty  
were i unbounden  all so may i the  
i woulde never eft come in the snare  
we wedded men live in sorrow and care  
assay it whoso will  and he shall find 
that i say sooth  by saint thomas of ind  
as for the more part  i say not all    
god shielde that it shoulde so befall  
ah  good sir host  i have y wedded be 
these moneths two  and more not  pardie  
and yet i trow that he that all his life 
wifeless hath been  though that men would him rive 
into the hearte  could in no mannere 
telle so much sorrow  as i you here 
could tellen of my wife s cursedness   
 now   quoth our host   merchant  so god you bless  
since ye so muche knowen of that art  
full heartily i pray you tell us part   
 gladly   quoth he   but of mine owen sore  
for sorry heart  i telle may no more   
 
the tale  
 
whilom there was dwelling in lombardy 
a worthy knight  that born was at pavie  
in which he liv d in great prosperity  
and forty years a wifeless man was he  
and follow d aye his bodily delight 
on women  where as was his appetite  
as do these fooles that be seculeres  
and  when that he was passed sixty years  
were it for holiness  or for dotage  
i cannot say  but such a great corage 
hadde this knight to be a wedded man  
that day and night he did all that he can 
to espy where that he might wedded be  
praying our lord to grante him  that he 
mighte once knowen of that blissful life 
that is betwixt a husband and his wife  
and for to live under that holy bond 
with which god firste man and woman bond  
 none other life   said he   is worth a bean  
for wedlock is so easy  and so clean  
that in this world it is a paradise   
thus said this olde knight  that was so wise  
and certainly  as sooth as god is king  
to take a wife it is a glorious thing  
and namely when a man is old and hoar  
then is a wife the fruit of his treasor  
then should he take a young wife and a fair  
on which he might engender him an heir  
and lead his life in joy and in solace  
whereas these bachelors singen  alas   
when that they find any adversity 
in love  which is but childish vanity  
and truely it sits well to be so  
that bachelors have often pain and woe  
on brittle ground they build  and brittleness 
they finde when they weene sickerness  
they live but as a bird or as a beast  is security 
in liberty  and under no arrest  
whereas a wedded man in his estate 
liveth a life blissful and ordinate  
under the yoke of marriage y bound  
well may his heart in joy and bliss abound  
for who can be so buxom as a wife  
who is so true  and eke so attentive 
to keep him  sick and whole  as is his make  
for weal or woe she will him not forsake  
she is not weary him to love and serve  
though that he lie bedrid until he sterve  
and yet some clerkes say it is not so  
of which he  theophrast  is one of tho  
what force though theophrast list for to lie  
 take no wife   quoth he   for husbandry  
as for to spare in household thy dispence  
a true servant doth more diligence 
thy good to keep  than doth thine owen wife  
for she will claim a half part all her life  
and if that thou be sick  so god me save  
thy very friendes  or a true knave  
will keep thee bet than she  that waiteth aye 
after thy good  and hath done many a day   
this sentence  and a hundred times worse  
writeth this man  there god his bones curse  
but take no keep of all such vanity  ice 
defy theophrast  and hearken to me  
a wife is godde s gifte verily  
all other manner giftes hardily  
as handes  rentes  pasture  or commune  
or mebles  all be giftes of fortune  
that passen as a shadow on the wall  
but dread thou not  if plainly speak i shall  
a wife will last  and in thine house endure  
well longer than thee list  paraventure  
marriage is a full great sacrament  
he which that hath no wife  i hold him shent  
he liveth helpless  and all desolate 
i speak of folk in secular estate  
and hearken why  i say not this for nought    
that woman is for manne s help y wrought  
the highe god  when he had adam maked  
and saw him all alone belly naked  
god of his greate goodness saide then  
let us now make a help unto this man 
like to himself  and then he made him eve  
here may ye see  and hereby may ye preve  
that a wife is mannes help and his comfort  
his paradise terrestre and his disport  
so buxom and so virtuous is she  
they muste needes live in unity  
one flesh they be  and one blood  as i guess  
with but one heart in weal and in distress  
a wife  ah  saint mary  ben dicite  
how might a man have any adversity 
that hath a wife  certes i cannot say 
the bliss the which that is betwixt them tway  
there may no tongue it tell  or hearte think  
if he be poor  she helpeth him to swink  
she keeps his good  and wasteth never a deal  
all that her husband list  her liketh well  
she saith not ones nay  when he saith yea  
 do this   saith he   all ready  sir   saith she  
o blissful order  wedlock precious  
thou art so merry  and eke so virtuous  
and so commended and approved eke  
that every man that holds him worth a leek 
upon his bare knees ought all his life 
to thank his god  that him hath sent a wife  
or elles pray to god him for to send 
a wife  to last unto his life s end  
for then his life is set in sickerness  
he may not be deceived  as i guess  
so that he work after his wife s rede  
then may he boldely bear up his head  
they be so true  and therewithal so wise  
for which  if thou wilt worken as the wise  
do alway so as women will thee rede  
lo how that jacob  as these clerkes read  
by good counsel of his mother rebecc  
bounde the kiddes skin about his neck  
for which his father s benison he wan  
lo judith  as the story telle can  
by good counsel she godde s people kept  
and slew him  holofernes  while he slept  
lo abigail  by good counsel  how she 
saved her husband nabal  when that he 
should have been slain  and lo  esther also 
by counsel good deliver d out of woe 
the people of god  and made him  mardoche  
of assuere enhanced for to be  
there is nothing in gree superlative 
as saith senec above a humble wife  
suffer thy wife s tongue  as cato bit  
she shall command  and thou shalt suffer it  
and yet she will obey of courtesy  
a wife is keeper of thine husbandry  
well may the sicke man bewail and weep  
there as there is no wife the house to keep  
i warne thee  if wisely thou wilt wirch  
love well thy wife  as christ loveth his church  
thou lov st thyself  if thou lovest thy wife  
no man hateth his flesh  but in his life 
he fost reth it  and therefore bid i thee 
cherish thy wife  or thou shalt never the  
husband and wife  what so men jape or play  
of worldly folk holde the sicker way  and jeer 
they be so knit there may no harm betide  
and namely upon the wife s side  
for which this january  of whom i told  
consider d hath within his dayes old  
the lusty life  the virtuous quiet  
that is in marriage honey sweet  
and for his friends upon a day he sent 
to tell them the effect of his intent  
with face sad  his tale he hath them told  
he saide   friendes  i am hoar and old  
and almost god wot on my pitte s brink  
upon my soule somewhat must i think  
i have my body foolishly dispended  
blessed be god that it shall be amended  
for i will be certain a wedded man  
and that anon in all the haste i can  
unto some maiden  fair and tender of age  
i pray you shape for my marriage 
all suddenly  for i will not abide  
and i will fond to espy  on my side  
to whom i may be wedded hastily  
but forasmuch as ye be more than  
ye shalle rather such a thing espy 
than i  and where me best were to ally  
but one thing warn i you  my friendes dear  
i will none old wife have in no mannere  
she shall not passe sixteen year certain  
old fish and younge flesh would i have fain  
better   quoth he   a pike than a pickerel  
and better than old beef is tender veal  
i will no woman thirty year of age  
it is but beanestraw and great forage  
and eke these olde widows god it wot 
they conne so much craft on wade s boat  
so muche brooke harm when that them lest  
that with them should i never live in rest  
for sundry schooles make subtle clerkes  
woman of many schooles half a clerk is  
but certainly a young thing men may guy  
right as men may warm wax with handes ply  
wherefore i say you plainly in a clause  
i will none old wife have  right for this cause  
for if so were i hadde such mischance  
that i in her could have no pleasance  
then should i lead my life in avoutrie  
and go straight to the devil when i die  
nor children should i none upon her getten  
yet were me lever houndes had me eaten 
than that mine heritage shoulde fall 
in strange hands  and this i tell you all  
i doubte not i know the cause why 
men shoulde wed  and farthermore know i 
there speaketh many a man of marriage 
that knows no more of it than doth my page  
for what causes a man should take a wife  
if he ne may not live chaste his life  
take him a wife with great devotion  
because of lawful procreation 
of children  to th  honour of god above  
and not only for paramour or love  
and for they shoulde lechery eschew  
and yield their debte when that it is due  
or for that each of them should help the other 
in mischief  as a sister shall the brother  
and live in chastity full holily  
but  sires  by your leave  that am not i  
for  god be thanked  i dare make avaunt  
i feel my limbes stark and suffisant 
to do all that a man belongeth to  
i wot myselfe best what i may do  
though i be hoar  i fare as doth a tree  
that blossoms ere the fruit y waxen be  
the blossomy tree is neither dry nor dead  
i feel me now here hoar but on my head  
mine heart and all my limbes are as green 
as laurel through the year is for to seen  
and  since that ye have heard all mine intent  
i pray you to my will ye would assent   
diverse men diversely him told 
of marriage many examples old  
some blamed it  some praised it  certain  
but at the haste  shortly for to sayn 
as all day falleth altercation 
betwixte friends in disputation  
there fell a strife betwixt his brethren two  
of which that one was called placebo  
justinus soothly called was that other  
placebo said   o january  brother  
full little need have ye  my lord so dear  
counsel to ask of any that is here  
but that ye be so full of sapience  
that you not liketh  for your high prudence  
to waive from the word of solomon  
this word said he unto us every one  
work alle thing by counsel    thus said he    
and thenne shalt thou not repente thee 
but though that solomon spake such a word  
mine owen deare brother and my lord  
so wisly god my soule bring at rest  
i hold your owen counsel is the best  
for  brother mine  take of me this motive  
i have now been a court man all my life  
and  god it wot  though i unworthy be  
i have standen in full great degree 
aboute lordes of full high estate  
yet had i ne er with none of them debate  
i never them contraried truely  
i know well that my lord can more than i  
what that he saith i hold it firm and stable  
i say the same  or else a thing semblable  
a full great fool is any counsellor 
that serveth any lord of high honour 
that dare presume  or ones thinken it  
that his counsel should pass his lorde s wit  
nay  lordes be no fooles by my fay  
ye have yourselfe shewed here to day 
so high sentence  so holily and well 
that i consent  and confirm every deal 
your wordes all  and your opinioun 
by god  there is no man in all this town 
nor in itale  could better have y said  
christ holds him of this counsel well apaid  
and truely it is a high courage 
of any man that stopen is in age  
to take a young wife  by my father s kin  
your hearte hangeth on a jolly pin  
do now in this matter right as you lest  
for finally i hold it for the best   
justinus  that aye stille sat and heard  
right in this wise to placebo answer d  
 now  brother mine  be patient i pray  
since ye have said  and hearken what i say  
senec  among his other wordes wise  
saith  that a man ought him right well advise  
to whom he gives his hand or his chattel  
and since i ought advise me right well 
to whom i give my good away from me  
well more i ought advise me  pardie  
to whom i give my body  for alway 
i warn you well it is no childe s play 
to take a wife without advisement  
men must inquire this is mine assent 
whe er she be wise  or sober  or dronkelew  
or proud  or any other ways a shrew  
a chidester  or a waster of thy good  
or rich or poor  or else a man is wood  
albeit so  that no man finde shall 
none in this world  that teth whole in all  
no man  nor beast  such as men can devise  every point 
but nathehess it ought enough suffice 
with any wife  if so were that she had 
more goode thewes than her vices bad  
and all this asketh leisure to inquere  
for  god it wot  i have wept many a tear 
full privily  since i have had a wife  
praise whoso will a wedded manne s life  
certes  i find in it but cost and care  
and observances of all blisses bare  
and yet  god wot  my neighebours about  
and namely of women many a rout  
say that i have the moste steadfast wife  
and eke the meekest one  that beareth life  
but i know best where wringeth me my shoe  
ye may for me right as you like do 
advise you  ye be a man of age  
how that ye enter into marriage  
and namely with a young wife and a fair  
by him that made water  fire  earth  air  
the youngest man that is in all this rout 
is busy enough to bringen it about 
to have his wife alone  truste me  
ye shall not please her fully yeares three  
this is to say  to do her full pleasance  
a wife asketh full many an observance  
i pray you that ye be not apaid   
 well   quoth this january   and hast thou said  
straw for thy senec  and for thy proverbs  
i counte not a pannier full of herbs 
of schoole termes  wiser men than thou  
as thou hast heard  assented here right now 
to my purpose  placebo  what say ye   
 i say it is a cursed man   quoth he  
 that letteth matrimony  sickerly   
and with that word they rise up suddenly  
and be assented fully  that he should 
be wedded when him list  and where he would  
high fantasy and curious business 
from day to day gan in the soul impress 
of january about his marriage 
many a fair shape  and many a fair visage 
there passed through his hearte night by night  
as whoso took a mirror polish d bright  
and set it in a common market place  
then should he see many a figure pace 
by his mirror  and in the same wise 
gan january in his thought devise 
of maidens  which that dwelte him beside  
he wiste not where that he might abide  
for if that one had beauty in her face  
another stood so in the people s grace 
for her sadness and her benignity  
that of the people greatest voice had she  
and some were rich and had a badde name  
but natheless  betwixt earnest and game  
he at the last appointed him on one  
and let all others from his hearte gon  
and chose her of his own authority  
for love is blind all day  and may not see  
and when that he was into bed y brought  
he pourtray d in his heart and in his thought 
her freshe beauty  and her age tender  
her middle small  her armes long and slender  
her wise governance  her gentleness  
her womanly bearing  and her sadness  
and when that he on her was condescended  
he thought his choice might not be amended  
for when that he himself concluded had  
he thought each other manne s wit so bad  
that impossible it were to reply 
against his choice  this was his fantasy  
his friendes sent he to  at his instance  
and prayed them to do him that pleasance  
that hastily they would unto him come  
he would abridge their labour all and some  
needed no more for them to go nor ride  
he was appointed where he would abide  
placebo came  and eke his friendes soon  
and alderfirst he bade them all a boon  
that none of them no arguments would make 
against the purpose that he had y take  
which purpose was pleasant to god  said he  
and very ground of his prosperity  
he said  there was a maiden in the town  
which that of beauty hadde great renown  
all were it so she were of small degree  
sufficed him her youth and her beauty  
which maid  he said  he would have to his wife  
to lead in ease and holiness his life  
and thanked god  that he might have her all  
that no wight with his blisse parte shall  
and prayed them to labour in this need  
and shape that he faile not to speed  
for then  he said  his spirit was at ease  
 then is   quoth he   nothing may me displease  
save one thing pricketh in my conscience  
the which i will rehearse in your presence  
i have   quoth he   heard said  full yore ago  
there may no man have perfect blisses two  
this is to say  on earth and eke in heaven  
for though he keep him from the sinne s seven  
and eke from every branch of thilke tree  
yet is there so perfect felicity  
and so great ease and lust  in marriage  
that ev r i am aghast  now in mine age 
that i shall head now so merry a life  
so delicate  withoute woe or strife  
that i shall have mine heav n on earthe here  
for since that very heav n is bought so dear  
with tribulation and great penance  
how should i then  living in such pleasance 
as alle wedded men do with their wives  
come to the bliss where christ etern on live is  
this is my dread  and ye  my brethren tway  
assoile me this question  i you pray   
justinus  which that hated his folly  
answer d anon right in his japery  mockery  jesting way 
and  for he would his longe tale abridge  
he woulde no authority allege  
but saide   sir  so there be none obstacle 
other than this  god of his high miracle  
and of his mercy  may so for you wirch  
that  ere ye have your rights of holy church  
ye may repent of wedded manne s life  
in which ye say there is no woe nor strife  
and elles god forbid  but if he sent 
a wedded man his grace him to repent 
well often  rather than a single man  
and therefore  sir  the beste rede i can  
despair you not  but have in your memory  
paraventure she may be your purgatory  
she may be godde s means  and godde s whip  
and then your soul shall up to heaven skip 
swifter than doth an arrow from a bow  
i hope to god hereafter ye shall know 
that there is none so great felicity 
in marriage  nor ever more shall be  
that you shall let of your salvation  
so that ye use  as skill is and reason  
the lustes of your wife attemperly  
and that ye please her not too amorously  
and that ye keep you eke from other sin  
my tale is done  for my wit is but thin  
be not aghast hereof  my brother dear  
but let us waden out of this mattere  
the wife of bath  if ye have understand  
of marriage  which ye have now in hand  
declared hath full well in little space  
fare ye now well  god have you in his grace   
and with this word this justin  and his brother 
have ta en their leave  and each of them of other  
and when they saw that it must needes be  
they wroughte so  by sleight and wise treaty  
that she  this maiden  which that maius hight  
as hastily as ever that she might  
shall wedded be unto this january  
i trow it were too longe you to tarry  
if i told you of every script and band 
by which she was feoffed in his hand  
or for to reckon of her rich array 
but finally y comen is the day 
that to the churche bothe be they went  
for to receive the holy sacrament  
forth came the priest  with stole about his neck  
and bade her be like sarah and rebecc  
in wisdom and in truth of marriage  
and said his orisons  as is usage  
and crouched them  and prayed god should them bless  
and made all sicker enough with holiness  
thus be they wedded with solemnity  
and at the feaste sat both he and she  
with other worthy folk  upon the dais  
all full of joy and bliss is the palace  
and full of instruments  and of vitaille  
the moste dainteous of all itale  
before them stood such instruments of soun   
that orpheus  nor of thebes amphioun  
ne made never such a melody  
at every course came in loud minstrelsy  
that never joab trumped for to hear  
nor he  theodomas  yet half so clear 
at thebes  when the city was in doubt  
bacchus the wine them skinked all about  
and venus laughed upon every wight 
for january was become her knight  
and woulde both assaye his courage 
in liberty  and eke in marriage  
and with her firebrand in her hand about 
danced before the bride and all the rout  
and certainly i dare right well say this  
hymeneus  that god of wedding is  
saw never his life so merry a wedded man  
hold thou thy peace  thou poet marcian  
that writest us that ilke wedding merry 
of her philology and him mercury  
and of the songes that the muses sung  
too small is both thy pen  and eke thy tongue 
for to describen of this marriage  
when tender youth hath wedded stooping age  
there is such mirth that it may not be writ  
assay it youreself  then may ye wit 
if that i lie or no in this mattere  
maius  that sat with so benign a cheer  
her to behold it seemed faerie  
queen esther never look d with such an eye 
on assuere  so meek a look had she  
i may you not devise all her beauty  
but thus much of her beauty tell i may  
that she was hike the bright morrow of may 
full filled of all beauty and pleasance  
this january is ravish d in a trance  
at every time he looked in her face  
but in his heart he gan her to menace  
that he that night in armes would her strain 
harder than ever paris did helene  
but natheless yet had he great pity 
that thilke night offende her must he  
and thought   alas  o tender creature  
now woulde god ye mighte well endure 
all my courage  it is so sharp and keen  
i am aghast ye shall it not sustene  
but god forbid that i did all my might  
now woulde god that it were waxen night  
and that the night would lasten evermo   
i would that all this people were y go   
and finally he did all his labour  
as he best mighte  saving his honour  
to haste them from the meat in subtle wise  
the time came that reason was to rise  
and after that men dance  and drinke fast  
and spices all about the house they cast  
and full of joy and bliss is every man  
all but a squire  that highte damian  
who carv d before the knight full many a day  
he was so ravish d on his lady may  
that for the very pain he was nigh wood  
almost he swelt and swooned where he stood  
so sore had venus hurt him with her brand  
as that she bare it dancing in her hand  
and to his bed he went him hastily  
no more of him as at this time speak i  
but there i let him weep enough and plain  
till freshe may will rue upon his pain  
o perilous fire  that in the bedstraw breedeth  
o foe familiar  that his service bedeth  mestic 
o servant traitor  o false homely hewe  
like to the adder in bosom shy untrue  
god shield us alle from your acquaintance  
o january  drunken in pleasance 
of marriage  see how thy damian  
thine owen squier and thy boren man  
intendeth for to do thee villainy  
god grante thee thine homehy foe t  espy  
for in this world is no worse pestilence 
than homely foe  all day in thy presence  
performed hath the sun his arc diurn  
no longer may the body of him sojourn 
on the horizon  in that latitude  
night with his mantle  that is dark and rude  
gan overspread the hemisphere about  
for which departed is this lusty rout 
from january  with thank on every side  
home to their houses lustily they ride  
where as they do their thinges as them lest  
and when they see their time they go to rest  
soon after that this hasty january 
will go to bed  he will no longer tarry  
he dranke hippocras  clarre  and vernage 
of spices hot  to increase his courage  
and many a lectuary had he full fine  
such as the cursed monk dan constantine 
hath written in his book de coitu  
to eat them all he would nothing eschew  
and to his privy friendes thus said he  
 for godde s love  as soon as it may be  
let voiden all this house in courteous wise   
and they have done right as he will devise  
men drinken  and the travers draw anon  
the bride is brought to bed as still as stone  
and when the bed was with the priest y bless d  
out of the chamber every wight him dress d  
and january hath fast in arms y take 
his freshe may  his paradise  his make  
he lulled her  he kissed her full oft  
with thicke bristles of his beard unsoft  
like to the skin of houndfish  sharp as brere 
for he was shav n all new in his mannere  
he rubbed her upon her tender face  
and saide thus   alas  i must trespace 
to you  my spouse  and you greatly offend  
ere time come that i will down descend  
but natheless consider this   quoth he  
 there is no workman  whatsoe er he be  
that may both worke well and hastily  
this will be done at leisure perfectly  
it is no force how longe that we play  
in true wedlock coupled be we tway  
and blessed be the yoke that we be in  
for in our actes may there be no sin  
a man may do no sinne with his wife  
nor hurt himselfe with his owen knife  
for we have leave to play us by the law   
thus labour d he  till that the day gan daw  
and then he took a sop in fine clarre  
and upright in his bedde then sat he  
and after that he sang full loud and clear  
and kiss d his wife  and made wanton cheer  
he was all coltish  full of ragerie 
and full of jargon as a flecked pie  
the slacke skin about his necke shaked  
while that he sang  so chanted he and craked  
but god wot what that may thought in her heart  
when she him saw up sitting in his shirt 
in his night cap  and with his necke lean  
she praised not his playing worth a bean  
then said he thus   my reste will i take 
now day is come  i may no longer wake  
and down he laid his head and slept till prime  
and afterward  when that he saw his time  
up rose january  but freshe may 
helde her chamber till the fourthe day  
as usage is of wives for the best  
for every labour some time must have rest  
or elles longe may he not endure  
this is to say  no life of creature  
be it of fish  or bird  or beast  or man  
now will i speak of woeful damian  
that languisheth for love  as ye shall hear  
therefore i speak to him in this manneare  
i say   o silly damian  alas  
answer to this demand  as in this case  
how shalt thou to thy lady  freshe may  
telle thy woe  she will alway say nay  
eke if thou speak  she will thy woe bewray  
god be thine help  i can no better say  
this sicke damian in venus  fire 
so burned that he died for desire  
for which he put his life in aventure  
no longer might he in this wise endure  
but privily a penner gan he borrow  
and in a letter wrote he all his sorrow  
in manner of a complaint or a lay  
unto his faire freshe lady may  
and in a purse of silk  hung on his shirt  
he hath it put  and laid it at his heart  
the moone  that at noon was thilke day 
that january had wedded freshe may  
in ten of taure  was into cancer glided  
so long had maius in her chamber abided  
as custom is unto these nobles all  
a bride shall not eaten in the ball 
till dayes four  or three days at the least  
y passed be  then let her go to feast  
the fourthe day complete from noon to noon  
when that the highe masse was y done  
in halle sat this january  and may  
as fresh as is the brighte summer s day  
and so befell  how that this goode man 
remember d him upon this damian  
and saide   saint mary  how may this be  
that damian attendeth not to me  
is he aye sick  or how may this betide   
his squiers  which that stoode there beside  
excused him  because of his sickness  
which letted him to do his business  
none other cause mighte make him tarry  
 that me forthinketh   quoth this january 
 he is a gentle squier  by my truth  uneasiness 
if that he died  it were great harm and ruth  
he is as wise  as discreet  and secre   
as any man i know of his degree  
and thereto manly and eke serviceble  
and for to be a thrifty man right able  
but after meat  as soon as ever i may 
i will myself visit him  and eke may  
to do him all the comfort that i can   
and for that word him blessed every man  
that of his bounty and his gentleness 
he woulde so comforten in sickness 
his squier  for it was a gentle deed  
 dame   quoth this january   take good heed  
at after meat  ye with your women all 
when that ye be in chamb r out of this hall  
that all ye go to see this damian  
do him disport  he is a gentle man  
and telle him that i will him visite  
have i nothing but rested me a lite  
and speed you faste  for i will abide me a little 
till that ye sleepe faste by my side   
and with that word he gan unto him call 
a squier  that was marshal of his hall  
and told him certain thinges that he wo ld  
this freshe may hath straight her way y hold  
with all her women  unto damian  
down by his beddes side sat she than  
comforting him as goodly as she may  
this damian  when that his time he say  
in secret wise his purse  and eke his bill  
in which that he y written had his will  
hath put into her hand withoute more  
save that he sighed wondrous deep and sore  
and softely to her right thus said he  
 mercy  and that ye not discover me  
for i am dead if that this thing be kid   
the purse hath she in her bosom hid  
and went her way  ye get no more of me  
but unto january come is she  
that on his bedde s side sat full soft  
he took her  and he kissed her full oft  
and laid him down to sleep  and that anon  
she feigned her as that she muste gon 
there as ye know that every wight must need  
and when she of this bill had taken heed  
she rent it all to cloutes at the last  
and in the privy softely it cast  
who studieth now but faire freshe may  
adown by olde january she lay  
that slepte  till the cough had him awaked  
anon he pray d her strippe her all naked  
he would of her  he said  have some pleasance  
and said her clothes did him incumbrance  
and she obey d him  be her lefe or loth  
but  lest that precious folk be with me wroth  
how that he wrought i dare not to you tell  
or whether she thought it paradise or hell  
but there i let them worken in their wise 
till evensong ring  and they must arise  
were it by destiny  or aventure  
were it by influence  or by nature  
or constellation  that in such estate 
the heaven stood at that time fortunate 
as for to put a bill of venus  works 
for alle thing hath time  as say these clerks  
to any woman for to get her love  
i cannot say  but greate god above  
that knoweth that none act is causeless  
he deem of all  for i will hold my peace  
but sooth is this  how that this freshe may 
hath taken such impression that day 
of pity on this sicke damian  
that from her hearte she not drive can 
the remembrance for to do him ease  
 certain   thought she   whom that this thing displease 
i recke not  for here i him assure  
to love him best of any creature  
though he no more haddee than his shirt   
lo  pity runneth soon in gentle heart  
here may ye see  how excellent franchise 
in women is when they them narrow advise  
some tyrant is    as there be many a one    
that hath a heart as hard as any stone  
which would have let him sterven in the place 
well rather than have granted him her grace  
and then rejoicen in her cruel pride  
and reckon not to be a homicide  
this gentle may  full filled of pity  
right of her hand a letter maked she  
in which she granted him her very grace  
there lacked nought  but only day and place  
where that she might unto his lust suffice  
for it shall be right as he will devise  
and when she saw her time upon a day 
to visit this damian went this may  
and subtilly this letter down she thrust 
under his pillow  read it if him lust  
she took him by the hand  and hard him twist 
so secretly  that no wight of it wist  
and bade him be all whole  and forth she went 
to january  when he for her sent  
up rose damian the nexte morrow  
all passed was his sickness and his sorrow  
he combed him  he proined him and picked  
he did all that unto his lady liked  
and eke to january he went as low 
as ever did a dogge for the bow  
he is so pleasant unto every man 
for craft is all  whoso that do it can  
every wight is fain to speak him good  
and fully in his lady s grace he stood  
thus leave i damian about his need  
and in my tale forth i will proceed  
some clerke holde that felicity 
stands in delight  and therefore certain he  
this noble january  with all his might 
in honest wise as longeth to a knight  
shope him to live full deliciously  
his housing  his array  as honestly 
to his degree was maked as a king s  
amonges other of his honest things 
he had a garden walled all with stone  
so fair a garden wot i nowhere none  
for out of doubt i verily suppose 
that he that wrote the romance of the rose 
could not of it the beauty well devise  
nor priapus mighte not well suffice  
though he be god of gardens  for to tell 
the beauty of the garden  and the well 
that stood under a laurel always green  
full often time he  pluto  and his queen 
proserpina  and all their faerie  
disported them and made melody 
about that well  and danced  as men told  
this noble knight  this january old 
such dainty had in it to walk and play  
that he would suffer no wight to bear the key  
save he himself  for of the small wicket 
he bare always of silver a cliket  
with which  when that him list  he it unshet  
and when that he would pay his wife s debt  
in summer season  thither would he go  
and may his wife  and no wight but they two  
and thinges which that were not done in bed  
he in the garden them perform d and sped  
and in this wise many a merry day 
lived this january and fresh may  
but worldly joy may not always endure 
to january  nor to no creatucere  
o sudden hap  o thou fortune unstable  
like to the scorpion so deceivable  
that fhatt rest with thy head when thou wilt sting  
thy tail is death  through thine envenoming  
o brittle joy  o sweete poison quaint  
o monster  that so subtilly canst paint 
thy giftes  under hue of steadfastness  
that thou deceivest bothe more and less  
why hast thou january thus deceiv d  
that haddest him for thy full friend receiv d  
and now thou hast bereft him both his eyen  
for sorrow of which desireth he to dien  
alas  this noble january free  
amid his lust and his prosperity 
is waxen blind  and that all suddenly  
he weeped and he wailed piteously  
and therewithal the fire of jealousy 
lest that his wife should fall in some folly 
so burnt his hearte  that he woulde fain  
that some man bothe him and her had slain  
for neither after his death  nor in his life  
ne would he that she were no love nor wife  
but ever live as widow in clothes black  
sole as the turtle that hath lost her make  
but at the last  after a month or tway  
his sorrow gan assuage  soothe to say  
for  when he wist it might none other be  
he patiently took his adversity  
save out of doubte he may not foregon 
that he was jealous evermore in one  
which jealousy was so outrageous  
that neither in hall  nor in none other house  
nor in none other place never the mo  
he woulde suffer her to ride or go  
but if that he had hand on her alway  
for which full often wepte freshe may  
that loved damian so burningly 
that she must either dien suddenly  
or elles she must have him as her lest  
she waited when her hearte woulde brest  
upon that other side damian 
becomen is the sorrowfullest man 
that ever was  for neither night nor day 
he mighte speak a word to freshe may  
as to his purpose  of no such mattere  
but if that january must it hear  
that had a hand upon her evermo   
but natheless  by writing to and fro  
and privy signes  wist he what she meant  
and she knew eke the fine of his intent  
o january  what might it thee avail  
though thou might see as far as shippes sail  
for as good is it blind deceiv d to be  
as be deceived when a man may see  
lo  argus  which that had a hundred eyen  
for all that ever he could pore or pryen  
yet was he blent  and  god wot  so be mo   
that weene wisly that it be not so  
pass over is an ease  i say no more  
this freshe may  of which i spake yore  
in warm wax hath imprinted the cliket 
that january bare of the small wicket of the key 
by which into his garden oft he went  
and damian  that knew all her intent  
the cliket counterfeited privily  
there is no more to say  but hastily 
some wonder by this cliket shall betide  
which ye shall hearen  if ye will abide  
o noble ovid  sooth say st thou  god wot  
what sleight is it  if love be long and hot  
that he ll not find it out in some mannere  
by pyramus and thisbe may men lear  
though they were kept full long and strait o er all  
they be accorded  rowning through a wall    
where no wight could have found out such a sleight  
but now to purpose  ere that dayes eight 
were passed of the month of july  fill 
that january caught so great a will  
through egging of his wife  him for to play 
in his garden  and no wight but they tway  
that in a morning to this may said he  
 rise up  my wife  my love  my lady free  
the turtle s voice is heard  mine owen sweet  
the winter is gone  with all his raines weet  
come forth now with thine eyen columbine 
well fairer be thy breasts than any wine  
the garden is enclosed all about  
come forth  my white spouse  for  out of doubt  
thou hast me wounded in mine heart  o wife  
no spot in thee was e er in all thy life  
come forth  and let us taken our disport  
i choose thee for my wife and my comfort   
such olde lewed wordes used he  
on damian a signe made she  
that he should go before with his cliket  
this damian then hath opened the wicket  
and in he start  and that in such mannere 
that no wight might him either see or hear  
and still he sat under a bush  anon 
this january  as blind as is a stone  
with maius in his hand  and no wight mo   
into this freshe garden is y go  
and clapped to the wicket suddenly  
 now  wife   quoth he   here is but thou and i  
thou art the creature that i beste love  
for  by that lord that sits in heav n above  
lever i had to dien on a knife  
than thee offende  deare true wife  
for godde s sake  think how i thee chees  
not for no covetise doubteless  
but only for the love i had to thee  
and though that i be old  and may not see  
be to me true  and i will tell you why  
certes three thinges shall ye win thereby  
first  love of christ  and to yourself honour  
and all mine heritage  town and tow r  
i give it you  make charters as you lest  
this shall be done to morrow ere sun rest  
so wisly god my soule bring to bliss  
i pray you  on this covenant me kiss  
and though that i be jealous  wite me not  
ye be so deep imprinted in my thought  
that when that i consider your beauty  
and therewithal th unlikely eld of me  
i may not  certes  though i shoulde die  
forbear to be out of your company  
for very love  this is withoute doubt  
now kiss me  wife  and let us roam about   
this freshe may  when she these wordes heard  
benignely to january answer d  
but first and forward she began to weep  
 i have   quoth she   a soule for to keep 
as well as ye  and also mine honour  
and of my wifehood thilke tender flow r 
which that i have assured in your hond  
when that the priest to you my body bond  
wherefore i will answer in this mannere  
with leave of you mine owen lord so dear  
i pray to god  that never dawn the day 
that i no sterve  as foul as woman may  
if e er i do unto my kin that shame  
or elles i impaire so my name  
that i bee false  and if i do that lack  
do strippe me  and put me in a sack  
and in the nexte river do me drench  
i am a gentle woman  and no wench  
why speak ye thus  but men be e er untrue  
and women have reproof of you aye new  
ye know none other dalliance  i believe  
but speak to us of untrust and repreve   
and with that word she saw where damian 
sat in the bush  and coughe she began  
and with her finger signe made she  
that damian should climb upon a tree 
that charged was with fruit  and up he went  
for verily he knew all her intent  
and every signe that she coulde make  
better than january her own make  
for in a letter she had told him all 
of this matter  how that he worke shall  
and thus i leave him sitting in the perry  
and january and may roaming full merry  
bright was the day  and blue the firmament  
phoebus of gold his streames down had sent 
to gladden every flow r with his warmness  
he was that time in geminis  i guess  
but little from his declination 
of cancer  jove s exaltation  
and so befell  in that bright morning tide  
that in the garden  on the farther side  
pluto  that is the king of faerie  
and many a lady in his company 
following his wife  the queen proserpina    
which that he ravished out of ethna  
while that she gather d flowers in the mead 
in claudian ye may the story read  
how in his grisly chariot he her fet    
this king of faerie adown him set 
upon a bank of turfes fresh and green  
and right anon thus said he to his queen  
 my wife   quoth he   there may no wight say nay    
experience so proves it every day    
the treason which that woman doth to man  
ten hundred thousand stories tell i can 
notable of your untruth and brittleness 
o solomon  richest of all richess  
full fill d of sapience and worldly glory  
full worthy be thy wordes of memory 
to every wight that wit and reason can  
thus praised he yet the bounte of man  
 among a thousand men yet found i one  
but of all women found i never none   
thus said this king  that knew your wickedness  
and jesus  filius sirach  as i guess  
he spake of you but seldom reverence  
a wilde fire and corrupt pestilence 
so fall upon your bodies yet to night  
ne see ye not this honourable knight  
because  alas  that he is blind and old  
his owen man shall make him cuckold  
lo  where he sits  the lechour  in the tree  
now will i granten  of my majesty  
unto this olde blinde worthy knight  
that he shall have again his eyen sight  
when that his wife will do him villainy  
then shall be knowen all her harlotry  
both in reproof of her and other mo    
 yea  sir   quoth proserpine   and will ye so  
now by my mother ceres  soul i swear 
that i shall give her suffisant answer  
and alle women after  for her sake  
that though they be in any guilt y take  
with face bold they shall themselves excuse  
and bear them down that woulde them accuse  
for lack of answer  none of them shall dien  
all had ye seen a thing with both your eyen  
yet shall we visage it so hardily  
and weep  and swear  and chide subtilly  
that ye shall be as lewed as be geese  
what recketh me of your authorities  
i wot well that this jew  this solomon  
found of us women fooles many one  
but though that he founde no good woman  
yet there hath found many another man 
women full good  and true  and virtuous  
witness on them that dwelt in christes house  
with martyrdom they proved their constance  
the roman gestes make remembrance 
of many a very true wife also  
but  sire  be not wroth  albeit so  
though that he said he found no good woman  
i pray you take the sentence of the man  
he meant thus  that in sovereign bounte 
is none but god  no  neither he nor she  
hey  for the very god that is but one  
why make ye so much of solomon  
what though he made a temple  godde s house  
what though he were rich and glorious  
so made he eke a temple of false goddes  
how might he do a thing that more forbode 
pardie  as fair as ye his name emplaster  
he was a lechour  and an idolaster  
and in his eld he very god forsook  
and if that god had not as saith the book 
spared him for his father s sake  he should 
have lost his regne rather than he would  
i sette not of all the villainy 
that he of women wrote  a butterfly  
i am a woman  needes must i speak  
or elles swell until mine hearte break  
for since he said that we be jangleresses  
as ever may i brooke whole my tresses  
i shall not spare for no courtesy 
to speak him harm  that said us villainy   
 dame   quoth this pluto   be no longer wroth  
i give it up  but  since i swore mine oath 
that i would grant to him his sight again  
my word shall stand  that warn i you certain  
i am a king  it sits me not to lie   
 and i   quoth she   am queen of faerie  
her answer she shall have  i undertake  
let us no more wordes of it make  
forsooth  i will no longer you contrary   
now let us turn again to january  
that in the garden with his faire may 
singeth well merrier than the popinjay  
 you love i best  and shall  and other none   
so long about the alleys is he gone  
till he was come to ilke perry  
where as this damian satte full merry 
on high  among the freshe leaves green  
this freshe may  that is so bright and sheen  
gan for to sigh  and said   alas my side  
now  sir   quoth she   for aught that may betide  
i must have of the peares that i see  
or i must die  so sore longeth me 
to eaten of the smalle peares green  
help  for her love that is of heaven queen  
i tell you well  a woman in my plight 
may have to fruit so great an appetite  
that she may dien  but she of it have   
 alas   quoth he   that i had here a knave 
that coulde climb  alas  alas   quoth he  
 for i am blind    yea  sir  no force   quoth she  
 but would ye vouchesafe  for godde s sake  
the perry in your armes for to take 
for well i wot that ye mistruste me  
then would i climbe well enough   quoth she  
 so i my foot might set upon your back   
 certes   said he   therein shall be no lack  
might i you helpe with mine hearte s blood   
he stooped down  and on his back she stood  
and caught her by a twist  and up she go th  
ladies  i pray you that ye be not wroth  
i cannot glose  i am a rude man  
and suddenly anon this damian 
gan pullen up the smock  and in he throng  
and when that pluto saw this greate wrong  
to january he gave again his sight  
and made him see as well as ever he might  
and when he thus had caught his sight again  
was never man of anything so fain  
but on his wife his thought was evermo   
up to the tree he cast his eyen two  
and saw how damian his wife had dress d  
in such mannere  it may not be express d  
but if i woulde speak uncourteously  
and up he gave a roaring and a cry  
as doth the mother when the child shall die  
 out  help  alas  harow   he gan to cry  
 o stronge  lady  stowre  what doest thou   
and she answered   sir  what aileth you  
have patience and reason in your mind  
i have you help d on both your eyen blind  
on peril of my soul  i shall not lien  
as me was taught to helpe with your eyen  
was nothing better for to make you see  
than struggle with a man upon a tree  
god wot  i did it in full good intent   
 struggle   quoth he   yea  algate in it went  
god give you both one shame s death to dien  
he swived thee  i saw it with mine eyen  
and elles be i hanged by the halse   
 then is   quoth she   my medicine all false  
for certainly  if that ye mighte see  
ye would not say these wordes unto me  
ye have some glimpsing  and no perfect sight   
 i see   quoth he   as well as ever i might  
thanked be god  with both mine eyen two  
and by my faith me thought he did thee so   
 ye maze  ye maze  goode sir   quoth she  
 this thank have i for i have made you see  
alas   quoth she   that e er i was so kind   
 now  dame   quoth he   let all pass out of mind  
come down  my lefe  and if i have missaid  
god help me so  as i am apaid  
but  by my father s soul  i ween d have seen 
how that this damian had by thee lain  
and that thy smock had lain upon his breast   
 yea  sir   quoth she   ye may ween as ye lest  
but  sir  a man that wakes out of his sleep 
he may not suddenly well take keep 
upon a thing  nor see it perfectly  
till that he be adawed verily  
right so a man  that long hath blind y be  
he may not suddenly so well y see  
first when his sight is newe come again  
as he that hath a day or two y seen  
till that your sight establish d be a while  
there may full many a sighte you beguile  
beware  i pray you  for  by heaven s king  
full many a man weeneth to see a thing  
and it is all another than it seemeth  
he which that misconceiveth oft misdeemeth   
and with that word she leapt down from the tree  
this january  who is glad but he  
he kissed her  and clipped her full oft  
and on her womb he stroked her full soft  
and to his palace home he hath her lad  
now  goode men  i pray you to be glad  
thus endeth here my tale of january  
god bless us  and his mother  sainte mary  
 
the squire s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
 hey  godde s mercy   said our hoste tho  
 now such a wife i pray god keep me fro   
lo  suche sleightes and subtilities 
in women be  for aye as busy as bees 
are they us silly men for to deceive  
and from the soothe will they ever weive  
as this merchante s tale it proveth well  
but natheless  as true as any steel  
i have a wife  though that she poore be  
but of her tongue a labbing shrew is she  
and yet she hath a heap of vices mo   
thereof no force  let all such thinges go  
but wit ye what  in counsel be it said  
me rueth sore i am unto her tied  
for  an  i shoulde reckon every vice 
which that she hath  y wis i were too nice  
and cause why  it should reported be 
and told her by some of this company 
by whom  it needeth not for to declare  
since women connen utter such chaffare   
and eke my wit sufficeth not thereto 
to tellen all  wherefore my tale is do  
squier  come near  if it your wille be  
and say somewhat of love  for certes ye 
conne thereon as much as any man   
 nay  sir   quoth he   but such thing as i can  
with hearty will    for i will not rebel 
against your lust    a tale will i tell  
have me excused if i speak amiss  
my will is good  and lo  my tale is this   
 
the tale  
 
pars prima  
 
at sarra  in the land of tartary  
there dwelt a king that warrayed russie  
through which there died many a doughty man  
this noble king was called cambuscan  
which in his time was of so great renown  
that there was nowhere in no regioun 
so excellent a lord in alle thing  
him lacked nought that longeth to a king  
as of the sect of which that he was born  
he kept his law to which he was y sworn  
and thereto he was hardy  wise  and rich  
and piteous and just  always y lich  
true of his word  benign and honourable  
of his corage as any centre stable  
young  fresh  and strong  in armes desirous 
as any bachelor of all his house  
a fair person he was  and fortunate  
and kept alway so well his royal estate  
that there was nowhere such another man  
this noble king  this tartar cambuscan  
hadde two sons by elfeta his wife  
of which the eldest highte algarsife  
the other was y called camballo  
a daughter had this worthy king also  
that youngest was  and highte canace  
but for to telle you all her beauty  
it lies not in my tongue  nor my conning  
i dare not undertake so high a thing  
mine english eke is insufficient  
it muste be a rhetor excellent  orator 
that couth his colours longing for that art  
if he should her describen any part  
i am none such  i must speak as i can  
and so befell  that when this cambuscan 
had twenty winters borne his diadem  
as he was wont from year to year  i deem  
he let the feast of his nativity 
do crye  throughout sarra his city  
the last idus of march  after the year  
phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear  
for he was nigh his exaltation 
in marte s face  and in his mansion 
in aries  the choleric hot sign  
full lusty was the weather and benign  
for which the fowls against the sunne sheen  
what for the season and the younge green  
full loude sange their affections  
them seemed to have got protections 
against the sword of winter keen and cold  
this cambuscan  of which i have you told  
in royal vesture  sat upon his dais  
with diadem  full high in his palace  
and held his feast so solemn and so rich  
that in this worlde was there none it lich  
of which if i should tell all the array  
then would it occupy a summer s day  
and eke it needeth not for to devise 
at every course the order of service  
i will not tellen of their strange sewes  
nor of their swannes  nor their heronsews  
eke in that land  as telle knightes old  
there is some meat that is full dainty hold  
that in this land men reck of it full small  
there is no man that may reporten all  
i will not tarry you  for it is prime  
and for it is no fruit  but loss of time  
unto my purpose i will have recourse  
and so befell that  after the third course  
while that this king sat thus in his nobley  
hearing his ministreles their thinges play 
before him at his board deliciously  
in at the halle door all suddenly 
there came a knight upon a steed of brass  
and in his hand a broad mirror of glass  
upon his thumb he had of gold a ring  
and by his side a naked sword hanging  
and up he rode unto the highe board  
in all the hall was there not spoke a word  
for marvel of this knight  him to behold 
full busily they waited  young and old  
this strange knight  that came thus suddenly  
all armed  save his head  full richely  
saluted king  and queen  and lordes all  
by order as they satten in the hall  
with so high reverence and observance  
as well in speech as in his countenance  
that gawain with his olde courtesy  
though he were come again out of faerie  
him coulde not amende with a word  
and after this  before the highe board  by one word 
he with a manly voice said his message  
after the form used in his language  
withoute vice of syllable or letter  
and  for his tale shoulde seem the better  
accordant to his worde s was his cheer  
as teacheth art of speech them that it lear  
albeit that i cannot sound his style  
nor cannot climb over so high a stile  
yet say i this  as to commune intent  
thus much amounteth all that ever he meant  
if it so be that i have it in mind  
he said   the king of araby and ind  
my liege lord  on this solemne day 
saluteth you as he best can and may  
and sendeth you  in honour of your feast  
by me  that am all ready at your hest  
this steed of brass  that easily and well 
can in the space of one day naturel 
this is to say  in four and twenty hours  
whereso you list  in drought or else in show rs  
beare your body into every place 
to which your hearte willeth for to pace  
withoute wem of you  through foul or fair  
or if you list to fly as high in air 
as doth an eagle  when him list to soar  
this same steed shall bear you evermore 
withoute harm  till ye be where you lest 
though that ye sleepen on his back  or rest  
and turn again  with writhing of a pin  
he that it wrought  he coude many a gin  
he waited in any a constellation  
ere he had done this operation  
and knew full many a seal and many a bond 
this mirror eke  that i have in mine hond  
hath such a might  that men may in it see 
when there shall fall any adversity 
unto your realm  or to yourself also  
and openly who is your friend or foe  
and over all this  if any lady bright 
hath set her heart on any manner wight  
if he be false  she shall his treason see  
his newe love  and all his subtlety  
so openly that there shall nothing hide  
wherefore  against this lusty summer tide  
this mirror  and this ring that ye may see  
he hath sent to my lady canace  
your excellente daughter that is here  
the virtue of this ring  if ye will hear  
is this  that if her list it for to wear 
upon her thumb  or in her purse it bear  
there is no fowl that flyeth under heaven  
that she shall not well understand his steven  
and know his meaning openly and plain  
and answer him in his language again  
and every grass that groweth upon root 
she shall eke know  to whom it will do boot  
all be his woundes ne er so deep and wide  
this naked sword  that hangeth by my side  
such virtue hath  that what man that it smite  
throughout his armour it will carve and bite  
were it as thick as is a branched oak  
and what man is y wounded with the stroke 
shall ne er be whole  till that you list  of grace  
to stroke him with the flat in thilke place 
where he is hurt  this is as much to sayn  
ye muste with the flatte sword again 
stroke him upon the wound  and it will close  
this is the very sooth  withoute glose  
it faileth not  while it is in your hold   
and when this knight had thus his tale told  
he rode out of the hall  and down he light  
his steede  which that shone as sunne bright  
stood in the court as still as any stone  
the knight is to his chamber led anon  
and is unarmed  and to meat y set  seated 
these presents be full richely y fet    
this is to say  the sword and the mirrour    
and borne anon into the highe tow r  
with certain officers ordain d therefor  
and unto canace the ring is bore 
solemnely  where she sat at the table  
but sickerly  withouten any fable  
the horse of brass  that may not be remued  
it stood as it were to the ground y glued  
there may no man out of the place it drive 
for no engine of windlass or polive  
and cause why  for they can not the craft  
and therefore in the place they have it laft  
till that the knight hath taught them the mannere 
to voide him  as ye shall after hear  
great was the press  that swarmed to and fro 
to gauren on this horse that stoode so  
for it so high was  and so broad and long  
so well proportioned for to be strong  
right as it were a steed of lombardy  
therewith so horsely  and so quick of eye  
as it a gentle poileis courser were  
for certes  from his tail unto his ear 
nature nor art ne could him not amend 
in no degree  as all the people wend  
but evermore their moste wonder was 
how that it coulde go  and was of brass  
it was of faerie  as the people seem d  
diverse folk diversely they deem d  
as many heads  as many wittes been  
they murmured  as doth a swarm of been  
and made skills after their fantasies  
rehearsing of the olde poetries  
and said that it was like the pegasee  
the horse that hadde winges for to flee  
or else it was the greeke s horse sinon  
that broughte troye to destruction  
as men may in the olde gestes read  
mine heart   quoth one   is evermore in dread  
i trow some men of armes be therein  
that shape them this city for to win  
it were right good that all such thing were know   
another rowned to his fellow low  
and said   he lies  for it is rather like 
an apparence made by some magic  
as jugglers playen at these feastes great   
of sundry doubts they jangle thus and treat  
as lewed people deeme commonly 
of thinges that be made more subtilly 
than they can in their lewdness comprehend  
they deeme gladly to the badder end  
and some of them wonder d on the mirrour  
that borne was up into the master tow r  
how men might in it suche thinges see  
another answer d and said  it might well be 
naturally by compositions 
of angles  and of sly reflections  
and saide that in rome was such a one  
they speak of alhazen and vitellon  
and aristotle  that wrote in their lives 
of quainte mirrors  and of prospectives  
as knowe they that have their bookes heard  
and other folk have wonder d on the swerd  
that woulde pierce throughout every thing  
and fell in speech of telephus the king  
and of achilles for his quainte spear  
for he could with it bothe heal and dere  
right in such wise as men may with the swerd 
of which right now ye have yourselves heard  
they spake of sundry hard ning of metal  
and spake of medicines therewithal  
and how  and when  it shoulde harden d be  
which is unknowen algate unto me  
then spake they of canacee s ring  
and saiden all  that such a wondrous thing 
of craft of rings heard they never none  
save that he  moses  and king solomon  
hadden a name of conning in such art  
thus said the people  and drew them apart  
put natheless some saide that it was 
wonder to maken of fern ashes glass  
and yet is glass nought like ashes of fern  
but for they have y knowen it so ferne 
therefore ceaseth their jangling and their wonder  
as sore wonder some on cause of thunder  
on ebb and flood  on gossamer and mist  
and on all things  till that the cause is wist  
thus jangle they  and deemen and devise  
till that the king gan from his board arise  
phoebus had left the angle meridional  
and yet ascending was the beast royal  
the gentle lion  with his aldrian  
when that this tartar king  this cambuscan  
rose from the board  there as he sat full high 
before him went the loude minstrelsy  
till he came to his chamber of parements  
there as they sounded diverse instruments  
that it was like a heaven for to hear  
now danced lusty venus  children dear  
for in the fish their lady sat full 
and looked on them with a friendly eye  
this noble king is set upon his throne  
this strange knight is fetched to him full sone  
and on the dance he goes with canace  
here is the revel and the jollity  
that is not able a dull man to devise  
he must have knowen love and his service  
and been a feastly man  as fresh as may  
that shoulde you devise such array  
who coulde telle you the form of dances 
so uncouth  and so freshe countenances 
such subtle lookings and dissimulances  
for dread of jealous men s apperceivings  
no man but launcelot  and he is dead  
therefore i pass o er all this lustihead 
i say no more  but in this jolliness 
i leave them  till to supper men them dress  
the steward bids the spices for to hie 
and eke the wine  in all this melody  
the ushers and the squiers be y gone  
the spices and the wine is come anon  
they eat and drink  and when this hath an end  
unto the temple  as reason was  they wend  
the service done  they suppen all by day 
what needeth you rehearse their array  
each man wot well  that at a kinge s feast 
is plenty  to the most  and to the least  
and dainties more than be in my knowing  
at after supper went this noble king 
to see the horse of brass  with all a rout 
of lordes and of ladies him about  
such wond ring was there on this horse of brass  
that  since the great siege of troye was  
there as men wonder d on a horse also  
ne er was there such a wond ring as was tho  
but finally the king asked the knight 
the virtue of this courser  and the might  
and prayed him to tell his governance  
the horse anon began to trip and dance  
when that the knight laid hand upon his rein  
and saide   sir  there is no more to sayn  
but when you list to riden anywhere  
ye muste trill a pin  stands in his ear  
which i shall telle you betwixt us two  
ye muste name him to what place also  
or to what country that you list to ride  
and when ye come where you list abide  
bid him descend  and trill another pin 
for therein lies th  effect of all the gin  
and he will down descend and do your will  
and in that place he will abide still  
though all the world had the contrary swore  
he shall not thence be throwen nor be bore  
or  if you list to bid him thennes gon  
trill this pin  and he will vanish anon 
out of the sight of every manner wight  
and come again  be it by day or night  
when that you list to clepe him again 
in such a guise  as i shall to you sayn 
betwixte you and me  and that full soon  
ride when you list  there is no more to do n   
informed when the king was of the knight  
and had conceived in his wit aright 
the manner and the form of all this thing  
full glad and blithe  this noble doughty king 
repaired to his revel as beforn  
the bridle is into the tower borne  
and kept among his jewels lefe and dear  
the horse vanish d  i n ot in what mannere  
out of their sight  ye get no more of me  
but thus i leave in lust and jollity 
this cambuscan his lordes feastying  
until well nigh the day began to spring  
 
pars secunda  
 
the norice of digestion  the sleep  
gan on them wink  and bade them take keep  
that muche mirth and labour will have rest  
and with a gaping mouth he all them kest  
and said  that it was time to lie down  
for blood was in his dominatioun  
 cherish the blood  nature s friend   quoth he  
they thanked him gaping  by two and three  
and every wight gan draw him to his rest  
as sleep them bade  they took it for the best  
their dreames shall not now be told for me  
full are their heades of fumosity  
that caused dreams of which there is no charge  
they slepte  till that  it was prime large  
the moste part  but it was canace  
she was full measurable  as women be  
for of her father had she ta en her leave 
to go to rest  soon after it was eve  
her liste not appalled for to be  
nor on the morrow unfeastly for to see  
and slept her firste sleep  and then awoke  
for such a joy she in her hearte took 
both of her quainte a ring and her mirrour   
that twenty times she changed her colour  
and in her sleep  right for th  impression 
of her mirror  she had a vision  
wherefore  ere that the sunne gan up glide  
she call d upon her mistress  her beside  
and saide  that her liste for to rise  
these olde women  that be gladly wise 
as are her mistresses answer d anon  
and said   madame  whither will ye gon 
thus early  for the folk be all in rest   
 i will   quoth she   arise  for me lest 
no longer for to sleep  and walk about   
her mistresses call d women a great rout  
and up they rose  well a ten or twelve  
up rose freshe canace herselve  
as ruddy and bright as is the yonnge sun 
that in the ram is four degrees y run  
no higher was he  when she ready was  
and forth she walked easily a pace  
array d after the lusty season swoot  
lightely for to play  and walk on foot  
nought but with five or six of her meinie  
and in a trench forth in the park went she  
the vapour  which up from the earthe glode  
made the sun to seem ruddy and broad  
but  natheless  it was so fair a sight 
that it made all their heartes for to light  
what for the season and the morrowning  
and for the fowles that she hearde sing  
for right anon she wiste what they meant 
right by their song  and knew all their intent  
the knotte  why that every tale is told  
if it be tarried till the list be cold 
of them that have it hearken d after yore  
the savour passeth ever longer more  
for fulsomness of the prolixity  
and by that same reason thinketh me  
i shoulde unto the knotte condescend  
and maken of her walking soon an end  
amid a tree fordry  as white as chalk  
there sat a falcon o er her head full high  
that with a piteous voice so gan to cry  
that all the wood resounded of her cry  
and beat she had herself so piteously 
with both her winges  till the redde blood 
ran endelong the tree  there as she stood 
and ever in one alway she cried and shright  
and with her beak herselfe she so pight  
that there is no tiger  nor cruel beast  
that dwelleth either in wood or in forest  
but would have wept  if that he weepe could  
for sorrow of her  she shriek d alway so loud  
for there was never yet no man alive  
if that he could a falcon well descrive  
that heard of such another of fairness 
as well of plumage  as of gentleness  
of shape  of all that mighte reckon d be  
a falcon peregrine seemed she  
of fremde land  and ever as she stood foreign 
she swooned now and now for lack of blood  
till well nigh is she fallen from the tree  
this faire kinge s daughter canace  
that on her finger bare the quainte ring  
through which she understood well every thing 
that any fowl may in his leden sayn  language 
and could him answer in his leden again  
hath understoode what this falcon said  
and well nigh for the ruth almost she died   
and to the tree she went  full hastily  
and on this falcon looked piteously  
and held her lap abroad  for well she wist 
the falcon muste falle from the twist 
when that she swooned next  for lack of blood  
a longe while to waite her she stood  
till at the last she apake in this mannere 
unto the hawk  as ye shall after hear  
 what is the cause  if it be for to tell  
that ye be in this furial pain of hell   
quoth canace unto this hawk above  
 is this for sorrow of of death  or loss of love  
for  as i trow  these be the causes two  
that cause most a gentle hearte woe  
of other harm it needeth not to speak  
for ye yourself upon yourself awreak  
which proveth well  that either ire or dread 
must be occasion of your cruel deed  
since that i see none other wight you chase  
for love of god  as yourselfe grace  
or what may be your help  for  west nor east  
i never saw ere now no bird nor beast 
that fared with himself so piteously 
ye slay me with your sorrow verily  
i have of you so great compassioun  
for godde s love come from the tree adown 
and  as i am a kinge s daughter true  
if that i verily the causes knew 
of your disease  if it lay in my might  
i would amend it  ere that it were night  
so wisly help me the great god of kind  
and herbes shall i right enoughe find  
to heale with your hurtes hastily   
then shriek d this falcon yet more piteously 
than ever she did  and fell to ground anon  
and lay aswoon  as dead as lies a stone  
till canace had in her lap her take  
unto that time she gan of swoon awake  
and  after that she out of swoon abraid  
right in her hawke s leden thus she said  
 that pity runneth soon in gentle heart 
feeling his simil tude in paines smart  
is proved every day  as men may see  
as well by work as by authority  
for gentle hearte kitheth gentleness  
i see well  that ye have on my distress 
compassion  my faire canace  
of very womanly benignity 
that nature in your princples hath set  
but for no hope for to fare the bet  
but for t  obey unto your hearte free  
and for to make others aware by me  
as by the whelp chastis d is the lion 
right for that cause and that conclusion  
while that i have a leisure and a space  
mine harm i will confessen ere i pace   
and ever while the one her sorrow told  
the other wept  as she to water wo ld  
till that the falcon bade her to be still  
and with a sigh right thus she said her till  
 where i was bred alas that ilke day  
and foster d in a rock of marble gray 
so tenderly  that nothing ailed me  
i wiste not what was adversity  
till i could flee full high under the sky  
then dwell d a tercelet me faste by  
that seem d a well of alle gentleness  
all were he full of treason and falseness  
it was so wrapped under humble cheer  
and under hue of truth  in such mannere  
under pleasance  and under busy pain  
that no wight weened that he coulde feign  
so deep in grain he dyed his colours  
right as a serpent hides him under flow rs  
till he may see his time for to bite  
right so this god of love s hypocrite 
did so his ceremonies and obeisances  
and kept in semblance all his observances  
that sounden unto gentleness of love  
as on a tomb is all the fair above  
and under is the corpse  which that ye wet  
such was this hypocrite  both cold and hot  
and in this wise he served his intent  
that  save the fiend  none wiste what he meant  
till he so long had weeped and complain d  
and many a year his service to me feign d  
till that mine heart  too piteous and too nice  
all innocent of his crowned malice  
forfeared of his death  as thoughte me  
upon his oathes and his surety he should die 
granted him love  on this conditioun  
that evermore mine honour and renown 
were saved  bothe privy and apert  
this is to say  that  after his desert  
i gave him all my heart and all my thought 
god wot  and he  that other wayes nought  
and took his heart in change of mine for aye  
but sooth is said  gone since many a day  
a true wight and a thiefe not one  
and when he saw the thing so far y gone  
that i had granted him fully my love  
in such a wise as i have said above  
and given him my true heart as free 
as he swore that he gave his heart to me  
anon this tiger  full of doubleness  
fell on his knees with so great humbleness  
with so high reverence  as by his cheer  
so like a gentle lover in mannere  
so ravish d  as it seemed  for the joy  
that never jason  nor paris of troy    
jason  certes  nor ever other man  
since lamech was  that alderfirst began 
to love two  as write folk beforn  
nor ever since the firste man was born  
coulde no man  by twenty thousand 
counterfeit the sophimes of his art  
where doubleness of feigning should approach  
nor worthy were t unbuckle his galoche  
nor could so thank a wight  as he did me  
his manner was a heaven for to see 
to any woman  were she ne er so wise  
so painted he and kempt  at point devise 
as well his wordes as his countenance  
and i so lov d him for his obeisance  
and for the truth i deemed in his heart  
that  if so were that any thing him smart  
all were it ne er so lite  and i it wist  
methought i felt death at my hearte twist  
and shortly  so farforth this thing is went  
that my will was his wille s instrument  
that is to say  my will obey d his will 
in alle thing  as far as reason fill  
keeping the boundes of my worship ever  
and never had i thing so lefe  or lever  
as him  god wot  nor never shall no mo   
 this lasted longer than a year or two  
that i supposed of him naught but good  
but finally  thus at the last it stood  
that fortune woulde that he muste twin 
out of that place which that i was in  
whe er me was woe  it is no question  
i cannot make of it description  
for one thing dare i telle boldely  
i know what is the pain of death thereby  
such harm i felt  for he might not byleve  
so on a day of me he took his leave  
so sorrowful eke  that i ween d verily  
that he had felt as muche harm as i  
when that i heard him speak  and saw his hue  
but natheless  i thought he was so true  
and eke that he repaire should again 
within a little while  sooth to sayn  
and reason would eke that he muste go 
for his honour  as often happ neth so  
that i made virtue of necessity  
and took it well  since that it muste be  
as i best might  i hid from him my sorrow  
and took him by the hand  saint john to borrow  
and said him thus   lo  i am youres all  
be such as i have been to you  and shall   
what he answer d  it needs not to rehearse  
who can say bet than he  who can do worse  
when he had all well said  then had he done  
therefore behoveth him a full long spoon  
that shall eat with a fiend  thus heard i say  
so at the last he muste forth his way  
and forth he flew  till he came where him lest  
when it came him to purpose for to rest  
i trow that he had thilke text in mind  
that alle thing repairing to his kind 
gladdeth himself  thus say men  as i guess  
men love of  proper  kind newfangleness  
as birdes do  that men in cages feed  
for though thou night and day take of them heed  
and strew their cage fair and soft as silk  
and give them sugar  honey  bread  and milk  
yet  right anon as that his door is up  
he with his feet will spurne down his cup  
and to the wood he will  and wormes eat  
so newefangle be they of their meat  
and love novelties  of proper kind  
no gentleness of bloode may them bind  
so far d this tercelet  alas the day  
though he were gentle born  and fresh  and gay  
and goodly for to see  and humble  and free  
he saw upon a time a kite flee  
and suddenly he loved this kite so  
that all his love is clean from me y go  
and hath his trothe falsed in this wise  
thus hath the kite my love in her service  
and i am lorn withoute remedy   
and with that word this falcon gan to cry  
and swooned eft in canacee s barme 
great was the sorrow  for that hawke s harm  
that canace and all her women made  
they wist not how they might the falcon glade  
but canace home bare her in her lap  
and softely in plasters gan her wrap  
there as she with her beak had hurt herselve  
now cannot canace but herbes delve 
out of the ground  and make salves new 
of herbes precious and fine of hue  
to heale with this hawk  from day to night 
she did her business  and all her might  
and by her bedde s head she made a mew  
and cover d it with velouettes blue  
in sign of truth that is in woman seen  
and all without the mew is painted green  
in which were painted all these false fowls  
as be these tidifes  tercelets  and owls  
and pies  on them for to cry and chide  
right for despite were painted them beside  
thus leave i canace her hawk keeping  
i will no more as now speak of her ring  
till it come eft to purpose for to sayn 
how that this falcon got her love again 
repentant  as the story telleth us  
by mediation of camballus  
the kinge s son of which that i you told  
but henceforth i will my process hold 
to speak of aventures  and of battailes  
that yet was never heard so great marvailles  
first i will telle you of cambuscan  
that in his time many a city wan  
and after will i speak of algarsife  
how he won theodora to his wife  
for whom full oft in great peril he was  
n had he been holpen by the horse of brass  
and after will i speak of camballo  
that fought in listes with the brethren two 
for canace  ere that he might her win  
and where i left i will again begin  
   
the franklin s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
 in faith  squier  thou hast thee well acquit  
and gentilly  i praise well thy wit   
quoth the franklin   considering thy youthe 
so feelingly thou speak st  sir  i aloue thee  
as to my doom  there is none that is here 
of eloquence that shall be thy peer  goes 
if that thou live  god give thee goode chance  
and in virtue send thee continuance  
for of thy speaking i have great dainty  
i have a son  and  by the trinity  
it were me lever than twenty pound worth land  
though it right now were fallen in my hand  
he were a man of such discretion 
as that ye be  fy on possession  
but if a man be virtuous withal  
i have my sone snibbed and yet shall  
for he to virtue listeth not t intend  
but for to play at dice  and to dispend  
and lose all that he hath  is his usage  
and he had lever talke with a page  
than to commune with any gentle wight  
there he might learen gentilless aright   
straw for your gentillesse   quoth our host  
 what  frankelin  pardie  sir  well thou wost 
that each of you must tellen at the least 
a tale or two  or breake his behest   
 that know i well  sir   quoth the frankelin  
 i pray you have me not in disdain  
though i to this man speak a word or two   
 tell on thy tale  withoute wordes mo    
 gladly  sir host   quoth he   i will obey 
unto your will  now hearken what i say  
i will you not contrary in no wise  
as far as that my wittes may suffice  
i pray to god that it may please you  
then wot i well that it is good enow  
 these olde gentle bretons  in their days  
of divers aventures made lays  
rhymeden in their firste breton tongue  
which layes with their instruments they sung  
or elles reade them for their pleasance  
and one of them have i in remembrance  
which i shall say with good will as i can  
but  sirs  because i am a borel man  
at my beginning first i you beseech 
have me excused of my rude speech  
i learned never rhetoric  certain  
thing that i speak  it must be bare and plain  
i slept never on the mount of parnasso  
nor learned marcus tullius cicero  
coloures know i none  withoute dread  
but such colours as growen in the mead  
or elles such as men dye with or paint  
colours of rhetoric be to me quaint  
my spirit feeleth not of such mattere  
but  if you list  my tale shall ye hear   
 
the tale  
 
in armoric   that called is bretagne  
there was a knight  that lov d and did his pain 
to serve a lady in his beste wise  
and many a labour  many a great emprise  
he for his lady wrought  ere she were won  
for she was one the fairest under sun  
and eke thereto come of so high kindred  
that well unnethes durst this knight for dread  
tell her his woe  his pain  and his distress 
but  at the last  she for his worthiness  
and namely for his meek obeisance  
hath such a pity caught of his penance  
that privily she fell of his accord 
to take him for her husband and her lord 
of such lordship as men have o er their wives  
and  for to lead the more in bliss their lives  
of his free will he swore her as a knight  
that never in all his life he day nor night 
should take upon himself no mastery 
against her will  nor kithe her jealousy  
but her obey  and follow her will in all  
as any lover to his lady shall  
save that the name of sovereignety 
that would he have  for shame of his degree  
she thanked him  and with full great humbless 
she saide   sir  since of your gentleness 
ye proffer me to have so large a reign  
ne woulde god never betwixt us twain  
as in my guilt  were either war or strife  
sir  i will be your humble true wife  
have here my troth  till that my hearte brest   
thus be they both in quiet and in rest  
for one thing  sires  safely dare i say  
that friends ever each other must obey  
if they will longe hold in company  
love will not be constrain d by mastery  
when mast ry comes  the god of love anon 
beateth his wings  and  farewell  he is gone  
love is a thing as any spirit free  
women of kind desire liberty  
and not to be constrained as a thrall  
and so do men  if soothly i say shall  
look who that is most patient in love  
he is at his advantage all above  
patience is a high virtue certain  advantages of all 
for it vanquisheth  as these clerkes sayn  
thinges that rigour never should attain  
for every word men may not chide or plain  
learne to suffer  or  so may i go  
ye shall it learn whether ye will or no  
for in this world certain no wight there is  
that he not doth or saith sometimes amiss  
ire  or sickness  or constellation  
wine  woe  or changing of complexion  
causeth full oft to do amiss or speaken  
on every wrong a man may not be wreaken  
after the time must be temperance 
to every wight that can of governance  
and therefore hath this worthy wise knight 
to live in ease sufferance her behight  
and she to him full wisly gan to swear 
that never should there be default in her  
here may men see a humble wife accord  
thus hath she ta en her servant and her lord  
servant in love  and lord in marriage  
then was he both in lordship and servage  
servage  nay  but in lordship all above  
since he had both his lady and his love  
his lady certes  and his wife also  
the which that law of love accordeth to  
and when he was in this prosperrity  
home with his wife he went to his country  
not far from penmark  where his dwelling was  
and there he liv d in bliss and in solace  
who coulde tell  but he had wedded be  
the joy  the ease  and the prosperity  
that is betwixt a husband and his wife  
a year and more lasted this blissful life  
till that this knight  of whom i spake thus  
that of cairrud was call d arviragus  
shope him to go and dwell a year or twain 
in engleland  that call d was eke britain  
to seek in armes worship and honour 
for all his lust he set in such labour  
and dwelled there two years  the book saith thus  
now will i stint of this arviragus  
and speak i will of dorigen his wife  
that lov d her husband as her hearte s life  
for his absence weepeth she and siketh  
as do these noble wives when them liketh  
she mourneth  waketh  waileth  fasteth  plaineth  
desire of his presence her so distraineth  
that all this wide world she set at nought  
her friendes  which that knew her heavy thought  
comforte her in all that ever they may  
they preache her  they tell her night and day  
that causeless she slays herself  alas  
and every comfort possible in this case 
they do to her  with all their business  
and all to make her leave her heaviness  
by process  as ye knowen every one  
men may so longe graven in a stone  
till some figure therein imprinted be  
so long have they comforted her  till she 
received hath  by hope and by reason  
th  imprinting of their consolation  
through which her greate sorrow gan assuage  
she may not always duren in such rage  
and eke arviragus  in all this care  
hath sent his letters home of his welfare  
and that he will come hastily again  
or elles had this sorrow her hearty slain  
her friendes saw her sorrow gin to slake  
and prayed her on knees for godde s sake 
to come and roamen in their company  
away to drive her darke fantasy  
and finally she granted that request  
for well she saw that it was for the best  
now stood her castle faste by the sea  
and often with her friendes walked she  
her to disport upon the bank on high  
there as many a ship and barge sigh  
sailing their courses  where them list to go  
but then was that a parcel of her woe  
for to herself full oft   alas   said she  
is there no ship  of so many as i see  
will bringe home my lord  then were my heart 
all warish d of this bitter paine s smart   
another time would she sit and think  
and cast her eyen downward from the brink  
but when she saw the grisly rockes blake  
for very fear so would her hearte quake  
that on her feet she might her not sustene 
then would she sit adown upon the green  
and piteously into the sea behold  
and say right thus  with ful sikes cold  
 eternal god  that through thy purveyance 
leadest this world by certain governance  
in idle  as men say  ye nothing make  
but  lord  these grisly fiendly rockes blake  
that seem rather a foul confusion 
of work  than any fair creation 
of such a perfect wise god and stable  
why have ye wrought this work unreasonable  
for by this work  north  south  or west  or east  
there is not foster d man  nor bird  nor beast  
it doth no good  to my wit  but annoyeth  
see ye not  lord  how mankind it destroyeth  
a hundred thousand bodies of mankind 
have rockes slain  all be they not in mind  
which mankind is so fair part of thy work  forgotten 
thou madest it like to thine owen mark  
then seemed it ye had a great cherte 
toward mankind  but how then may it be 
that ye such meanes make it to destroy  
which meanes do no good  but ever annoy  
i wot well  clerkes will say as them lest  
by arguments  that all is for the best  
although i can the causes not y know  
but thilke god that made the wind to blow  
as keep my lord  this is my conclusion  
to clerks leave i all disputation  
but would to god that all these rockes blake 
were sunken into helle for his sake 
these rockes slay mine hearte for the fear   
thus would she say  with many a piteous tear  
her friendes saw that it was no disport 
to roame by the sea  but discomfort  
and shope them for to playe somewhere else  
they leade her by rivers and by wells  
and eke in other places delectables  
they dancen  and they play at chess and tables  
so on a day  right in the morning tide  
unto a garden that was there beside  
in which that they had made their ordinance 
of victual  and of other purveyance  
they go and play them all the longe day  
and this was on the sixth morrow of may  
which may had painted with his softe showers 
this garden full of leaves and of flowers  
and craft of manne s hand so curiously 
arrayed had this garden truely  
that never was there garden of such price  
but if it were the very paradise  
th odour of flowers  and the freshe sight  
would have maked any hearte light 
that e er was born  but if too great sickness 
or too great sorrow held it in distress  
so full it was of beauty and pleasance  
and after dinner they began to dance 
and sing also  save dorigen alone 
who made alway her complaint and her moan  
for she saw not him on the dance go 
that was her husband  and her love also  
but natheless she must a time abide 
and with good hope let her sorrow slide  
upon this dance  amonge other men  
danced a squier before dorigen 
that fresher was  and jollier of array 
as to my doom  than is the month of may  
he sang and danced  passing any man  
that is or was since that the world began  
therewith he was  if men should him descrive  
one of the beste faring men alive  
young  strong  and virtuous  and rich  and wise  
and well beloved  and holden in great price  
and  shortly if the sooth i telle shall  
unweeting of this dorigen at all  
this lusty squier  servant to venus  
which that y called was aurelius  
had lov d her best of any creature 
two year and more  as was his aventure  
but never durst he tell her his grievance  
withoute cup he drank all his penance  
he was despaired  nothing durst he say  
save in his songes somewhat would he wray 
his woe  as in a general complaining  
he said  he lov d  and was belov d nothing  
of suche matter made he many lays  
songes  complaintes  roundels  virelays 
how that he durste not his sorrow tell  
but languished  as doth a fury in hell  
and die he must  he said  as did echo 
for narcissus  that durst not tell her woe  
in other manner than ye hear me say  
he durste not to her his woe bewray  
save that paraventure sometimes at dances  
where younge folke keep their observances  
it may well be he looked on her face 
in such a wise  as man that asketh grace  
but nothing wiste she of his intent  
nath less it happen d  ere they thennes went  ce from the 
because that he was her neighebour  garden 
and was a man of worship and honour  
and she had knowen him of time yore  
they fell in speech  and forth aye more and more 
unto his purpose drew aurelius  
and when he saw his time  he saide thus  
madam   quoth he   by god that this world made  
so that i wist it might your hearte glade  den 
i would  that day that your arviragus 
went over sea  that i  aurelius  
had gone where i should never come again  
for well i wot my service is in vain  
my guerdon is but bursting of mine heart  
madame  rue upon my paine s smart  
for with a word ye may me slay or save  
here at your feet god would that i were grave  
i have now no leisure more to say  
have mercy  sweet  or you will me dey   
she gan to look upon aurelius  
 is this your will   quoth she   and say ye thus  
ne er erst   quoth she   i wiste what ye meant  
but now  aurelius  i know your intent  
by thilke god that gave me soul and life  
never shall i be an untrue wife 
in word nor work  as far as i have wit  
i will be his to whom that i am knit  
take this for final answer as of me   
but after that in play thus saide she  
 aurelius   quoth she   by high god above  
yet will i grante you to be your love 
since i you see so piteously complain  
looke  what day that endelong bretagne 
ye remove all the rockes  stone by stone  
that they not lette ship nor boat to gon  
i say  when ye have made this coast so clean 
of rockes  that there is no stone seen  
then will i love you best of any man  
have here my troth  in all that ever i can  
for well i wot that it shall ne er betide  
let such folly out of your hearte glide  
what dainty should a man have in his life 
for to go love another manne s wife  
that hath her body when that ever him liketh   
aurelius full often sore siketh  
is there none other grace in you   quoth he  
 no  by that lord   quoth she   that maked me  
woe was aurelius when that he this heard  
and with a sorrowful heart he thus answer d  
 madame  quoth he   this were an impossible  
then must i die of sudden death horrible   
and with that word he turned him anon  
then came her other friends many a one  
and in the alleys roamed up and down  
and nothing wist of this conclusion  
but suddenly began to revel new  
till that the brighte sun had lost his hue  
for th  horizon had reft the sun his light 
this is as much to say as it was night  
and home they go in mirth and in solace  
save only wretch d aurelius  alas 
he to his house is gone with sorrowful heart  
he said  he may not from his death astart  
him seemed  that he felt his hearte cold  
up to the heav n his handes gan he hold  
and on his knees bare he set him down  
and in his raving said his orisoun  
for very woe out of his wit he braid  
he wist not what he spake  but thus he said  
with piteous heart his plaint hath he begun 
unto the gods  and first unto the sun  
he said   apollo god and governour 
of every plante  herbe  tree  and flower  
that giv st  after thy declination  
to each of them his time and his season  
as thine herberow changeth low and high  
lord phoebus  cast thy merciable eye 
on wretched aurelius  which that am but lorn  
lo  lord  my lady hath my death y sworn  
withoute guilt  but thy benignity 
upon my deadly heart have some pity  
for well i wot  lord phoebus  if you lest  
ye may me helpe  save my lady  best  
now vouchsafe  that i may you devise 
how that i may be holp  and in what wise  
your blissful sister  lucina the sheen  
that of the sea is chief goddess and queen    
though neptunus have deity in the sea  
yet emperess above him is she    
ye know well  lord  that  right as her desire 
is to be quick d and lighted of your fire  
for which she followeth you full busily  
right so the sea desireth naturally 
to follow her  as she that is goddess 
both in the sea and rivers more and less  
wherefore  lord phoebus  this is my request  
do this miracle  or mine hearte brest  
that flow  next at this opposition  to burst 
which in the sign shall be of the lion  
as praye her so great a flood to bring  
that five fathom at least it overspring 
the highest rock in armoric bretagne  
and let this flood endure yeares twain  
then certes to my lady may i say  
 holde your hest   the rockes be away  
lord phoebus  this miracle do for me  
pray her she go no faster course than ye  
i say this  pray your sister that she go 
no faster course than ye these yeares two  
then shall she be even at full alway  
and spring flood laste bothe night and day  
and but she vouchesafe in such mannere 
to grante me my sov reign lady dear  
pray her to sink every rock adown 
into her owen darke regioun 
under the ground  where pluto dwelleth in 
or nevermore shall i my lady win  
thy temple in delphos will i barefoot seek  
lord phoebus  see the teares on my cheek 
and on my pain have some compassioun   
and with that word in sorrow he fell down  
and longe time he lay forth in a trance  
his brother  which that knew of his penance  
up caught him  and to bed he hath him brought  
despaired in this torment and this thought 
let i this woeful creature lie  
choose he for me whe er he will live or die  
arviragus with health and great honour 
as he that was of chivalry the flow r 
is come home  and other worthy men  
oh  blissful art thou now  thou dorigen  
thou hast thy lusty husband in thine arms  
the freshe knight  the worthy man of arms  
that loveth thee as his own hearte s life  
nothing list him to be imaginatif 
if any wight had spoke  while he was out  
to her of love  he had of that no doubt  
he not intended to no such mattere  
but danced  jousted  and made merry cheer  
and thus in joy and bliss i let them dwell  
and of the sick aurelius will i tell 
in languor and in torment furious 
two year and more lay wretch d aurelius  
ere any foot on earth he mighte gon  
nor comfort in this time had he none  
save of his brother  which that was a clerk  
he knew of all this woe and all this work  
for to none other creature certain 
of this matter he durst no worde sayn  
under his breast he bare it more secree 
than e er did pamphilus for galatee  
his breast was whole withoute for to seen  
but in his heart aye was the arrow keen  
and well ye know that of a sursanure 
in surgery is perilous the cure  
but men might touch the arrow or come thereby  
his brother wept and wailed privily  
till at the last him fell in remembrance  
that while he was at orleans in france    
as younge clerkes  that be likerous   
to readen artes that be curious  
seeken in every halk and every hern 
particular sciences for to learn   
he him remember d  that upon a day 
at orleans in study a book he say 
of magic natural  which his fellaw  
that was that time a bachelor of law 
all were he there to learn another craft  
had privily upon his desk y laft  
which book spake much of operations 
touching the eight and twenty mansions 
that longe to the moon  and such folly 
as in our dayes is not worth a fly  
for holy church s faith  in our believe  
us suff reth none illusion to grieve  
and when this book was in his remembrance 
anon for joy his heart began to dance  
and to himself he saide privily  
 my brother shall be warish d hastily 
for i am sicker that there be sciences  
by which men make divers apparences  
such as these subtle tregetoures play  
for oft at feaste s have i well heard say  
that tregetours  within a halle large  
have made come in a water and a barge  
and in the halle rowen up and down  
sometimes hath seemed come a grim lioun  
and sometimes flowers spring as in a mead  
sometimes a vine  and grapes white and red  
sometimes a castle all of lime and stone  
and  when them liked  voided it anon  
thus seemed it to every manne s sight  
now then conclude i thus  if that i might 
at orleans some olde fellow find  
that hath these moone s mansions in mind  
or other magic natural above  
he should well make my brother have his love  
for with an appearance a clerk may make  
to manne s sight  that all the rockes blake 
of bretagne were voided every one  
and shippes by the brinke come and gon  
and in such form endure a day or two  
then were my brother warish d of his woe  
then must she needes holde her behest  
or elles he shall shame her at the least   
why should i make a longer tale of this  
unto his brother s bed he comen is  
and such comfort he gave him  for to gon 
to orleans  that he upstart anon  
and on his way forth ward then is he fare  
in hope for to be lissed of his care  
when they were come almost to that city  
but if it were a two furlong or three  
a young clerk roaming by himself they met  
which that in latin thriftily them gret  
and after that he said a wondrous thing  
i know   quoth he   the cause of your coming   
aud ere they farther any foote went  
he told them all that was in their intent  
the breton clerk him asked of fellaws 
the which he hadde known in olde daws  
and he answer d him that they deade were  
for which he wept full often many a tear  
down off his horse aurelius light anon  
and forth with this magician is be gone 
home to his house  and made him well at ease  
them lacked no vitail that might them please  
so well array d a house as there was one  
aurelius in his life saw never none  
he shewed him  ere they went to suppere  
forestes  parkes  full of wilde deer  
there saw he hartes with their hornes high  
the greatest that were ever seen with eye  
he saw of them an hundred slain with hounds  
and some with arrows bleed of bitter wounds  
he saw  when voided were the wilde deer  
these falconers upon a fair rivere  
that with their hawkes have the heron slain  
then saw he knightes jousting in a plain  
and after this he did him such pleasance  
that he him shew d his lady on a dance  
in which himselfe danced  as him thought  
and when this master  that this magic wrought  
saw it was time  he clapp d his handes two  
and farewell  all the revel is y go  
and yet remov d they never out of the house  
while they saw all the sightes marvellous  
but in his study  where his bookes be  
they satte still  and no wight but they three  
to him this master called his squier  
and said him thus   may we go to supper  
almost an hour it is  i undertake  
since i you bade our supper for to make  
when that these worthy men wente with me 
into my study  where my bookes be   
 sir   quoth this squier   when it liketh you  
it is all ready  though ye will right now   
 go we then sup   quoth he   as for the best  
these amorous folk some time must have rest   
at after supper fell they in treaty 
what summe should this master s guerdon be  
to remove all the rockes of bretagne  
and eke from gironde to the mouth of seine  
he made it strange  and swore  so god him save  
less than a thousand pound he would not have  difficulty 
nor gladly for that sum he would not gon  
aurelius with blissful heart anon 
answered thus   fie on a thousand pound  
this wide world  which that men say is round  
i would it give  if i were lord of it  
this bargain is full driv n  for we be knit  
ye shall be payed truly by my troth  
but looke  for no negligence or sloth  
ye tarry us here no longer than to morrow   
 nay   quoth the clerk   have here my faith to borrow   
to bed is gone aurelius when him lest  faith on it 
and well nigh all that night he had his rest  
what for his labour  and his hope of bliss  
his woeful heart of penance had a liss  
 
upon the morrow  when that it was day  
unto bretagne they took the righte way  
aurelius and this magician beside  
and be descended where they would abide  
and this was  as the bookes me remember  
the colde frosty season of december  
phoebus wax d old  and hued like latoun  
that in his hote declinatioun 
shone as the burned gold  with streames bright  
but now in capricorn adown he light  
where as he shone full pale  i dare well sayn  
the bitter frostes  with the sleet and rain  
destroyed have the green in every yard  
janus sits by the fire with double beard  
and drinketh of his bugle horn the wine  
before him stands the brawn of tusked swine 
and  nowel  crieth every lusty man 
aurelius  in all that ev r he can  
did to his master cheer and reverence  
and prayed him to do his diligence 
to bringe him out of his paines smart  
or with a sword that he would slit his heart  
this subtle clerk such ruth had on this man  
that night and day he sped him  that he can  
to wait a time of his conclusion  
this is to say  to make illusion  
by such an appearance of jugglery 
i know no termes of astrology  
that she and every wight should ween and say  
that of bretagne the rockes were away  
or else they were sunken under ground  
so at the last he hath a time found 
to make his japes and his wretchedness 
of such a superstitious cursedness  
his tables toletanes forth he brought  
full well corrected  that there lacked nought  
neither his collect  nor his expanse years  
neither his rootes  nor his other gears  
as be his centres  and his arguments  
and his proportional convenients 
for his equations in everything  
and by his eighte spheres in his working  
he knew full well how far alnath was shove 
from the head of that fix d aries above  
that in the ninthe sphere consider d is  
full subtilly he calcul d all this  
when he had found his firste mansion  
he knew the remnant by proportion  
and knew the rising of his moone well  
and in whose face  and term  and every deal  
and knew full well the moone s mansion 
accordant to his operation  
and knew also his other observances  
for such illusions and such meschances  devices 
as heathen folk used in thilke days  
for which no longer made he delays  
but through his magic  for a day or tway  
it seemed all the rockes were away  
aurelius  which yet despaired is 
whe er he shall have his love  or fare amiss  
awaited night and day on this miracle  
and when he knew that there was none obstacle  
that voided were these rockes every one  
down at his master s feet he fell anon  
and said   i  woeful wretch d aurelius  
thank you  my lord  and lady mine venus  
that me have holpen from my cares cold   
and to the temple his way forth hath he hold  
where as he knew he should his lady see  
and when he saw his time  anon right he 
with dreadful heart and with full humble cheer 
saluteth hath his sovereign lady dear  
 my rightful lady   quoth this woeful man  
 whom i most dread  and love as i best can  
and lothest were of all this world displease  
were t not that i for you have such disease  
that i must die here at your foot anon  
nought would i tell how me is woebegone  
but certes either must i die or plain  
ye slay me guilteless for very pain  
but of my death though that ye have no ruth  
advise you  ere that ye break your truth  
repente you  for thilke god above  
ere ye me slay because that i you love  
for  madame  well ye wot what ye have hight  
not that i challenge anything of right 
of you  my sovereign lady  but of grace  
but in a garden yond   in such a place  
ye wot right well what ye behighte me  
and in mine hand your trothe plighted ye  
to love me best  god wot ye saide so  
albeit that i unworthy am thereto  
madame  i speak it for th  honour of you  
more than to save my hearte s life right now  
i have done so as ye commanded me  
and if ye vouchesafe  ye may go see  
do as you list  have your behest in mind  
for  quick or dead  right there ye shall me find  
in you hes all to me live or dey  
but well i wot the rockes be away   
he took his leave  and she astonish d stood  
in all her face was not one drop of blood  
she never ween d t have come in such a trap  
 alas   quoth she   that ever this should hap  
for ween d i ne er  by possibility  
that such a monster or marvail might be  
it is against the process of nature   
and home she went a sorrowful creature  
for very fear unnethes may she go  
she weeped  wailed  all a day or two  
and swooned  that it ruthe was to see  
but why it was  to no wight tolde she  
for out of town was gone arviragus  
but to herself she spake  and saide thus  
with face pale  and full sorrowful cheer  
in her complaint  as ye shall after hear  
 alas   quoth she   on thee  fortune  i plain  
that unware hast me wrapped in thy chain  
from which to scape  wot i no succour  
save only death  or elles dishonour  
one of these two behoveth me to choose  
but natheless  yet had i lever lose 
my life  than of my body have shame  
or know myselfe false  or lose my name  
and with my death i may be quit y wis  
hath there not many a noble wife  ere this  my exemption 
and many a maiden  slain herself  alas  
rather than with her body do trespass  
yes  certes  lo  these stories bear witness  
when thirty tyrants full of cursedness 
had slain phidon in athens at the feast  
they commanded his daughters to arrest  
and bringe them before them  in despite  
all naked  to fulfil their foul delight  
and in their father s blood they made them dance 
upon the pavement    god give them mischance  
for which these woeful maidens  full of dread  
rather than they would lose their maidenhead  
they privily be start into a well  
and drowned themselves  as the bookes tell  
they of messene let inquire and seek 
of lacedaemon fifty maidens eke  
on which they woulde do their lechery  
but there was none of all that company 
that was not slain  and with a glad intent 
chose rather for to die  than to assent 
to be oppressed of her maidenhead  
why should i then to dien be in dread  
lo  eke the tyrant aristoclides  
that lov d a maiden hight stimphalides  
when that her father slain was on a night  
unto diana s temple went she right  
and hent the image in her handes two  
from which image she woulde never go  
no wight her handes might off it arace  
till she was slain right in the selfe place  
now since that maidens hadde such despite 
to be defouled with man s foul delight  
well ought a wife rather herself to sle  
than be defouled  as it thinketh me  
what shall i say of hasdrubale s wife  
that at carthage bereft herself of life  
for  when she saw the romans win the town  
she took her children all  and skipt adown 
into the fire  and rather chose to die  
than any roman did her villainy  
hath not lucretia slain herself  alas  
at rome  when that she oppressed was 
of tarquin  for her thought it was a shame 
to live  when she hadde lost her name  
the seven maidens of milesie also 
have slain themselves for very dread and woe  
rather than folk of gaul them should oppress  
more than a thousand stories  as i guess  
could i now tell as touching this mattere  
when abradate was slain  his wife so dear 
herselfe slew  and let her blood to glide 
in abradate s woundes  deep and wide  
and said   my body at the leaste way 
there shall no wight defoul  if that i may   
why should i more examples hereof sayn  
since that so many have themselves slain  
well rather than they would defouled be  
i will conclude that it is bet for me 
to slay myself  than be defouled thus  
i will be true unto arviragus  
or elles slay myself in some mannere  
as did demotione s daughter dear  
because she woulde not defouled be  
o sedasus  it is full great pity 
to reade how thy daughters died  alas  
that slew themselves for suche manner cas  
as great a pity was it  or well more  the same kind 
the theban maiden  that for nicanor 
herselfe slew  right for such manner woe  
another theban maiden did right so  
for one of macedon had her oppress d  
she with her death her maidenhead redress d  
what shall i say of niceratus  wife  
that for such case bereft herself her life  
how true was eke to alcibiades 
his love  that for to dien rather chese  
than for to suffer his body unburied be  
lo  what a wife was alceste   quoth she  
 what saith homer of good penelope  
all greece knoweth of her chastity  
pardie  of laedamia is written thus  
that when at troy was slain protesilaus  
no longer would she live after his day  
the same of noble porcia tell i may  
withoute brutus coulde she not live  
to whom she did all whole her hearte give  
the perfect wifehood of artemisie 
honoured is throughout all barbarie  
o teuta queen  thy wifely chastity 
to alle wives may a mirror be   
thus plained dorigen a day or tway  
purposing ever that she woulde dey  
but natheless upon the thirde night 
home came arviragus  the worthy knight  
and asked her why that she wept so sore  
and she gan weepen ever longer more  
 alas   quoth she   that ever i was born  
thus have i said   quoth she   thus have i sworn   
and told him all  as ye have heard before  
it needeth not rehearse it you no more  
this husband with glad cheer  in friendly wise  
answer d and said  as i shall you devise  
 is there aught elles  dorigen  but this   
 nay  nay   quoth she   god help me so  as wis 
this is too much  an it were godde s will   
 yea  wife   quoth he   let sleepe what is still  
it may be well par venture yet to day  
ye shall your trothe holde  by my fay  
for  god so wisly have mercy on me  
i had well lever sticked for to be  
for very love which i to you have  
but if ye should your trothe keep and save  
truth is the highest thing that man may keep   
but with that word he burst anon to weep  
and said   i you forbid  on pain of death  
that never  while you lasteth life or breath  
to no wight tell ye this misaventure  
as i may best  i will my woe endure  
nor make no countenance of heaviness  
that folk of you may deeme harm  or guess   
and forth he call d a squier and a maid  
 go forth anon with dorigen   he said  
 and bringe her to such a place anon   
they take their leave  and on their way they gon  
but they not wiste why she thither went  
he would to no wight telle his intent  
this squier  which that hight aurelius  
on dorigen that was so amorous  
of aventure happen d her to meet 
amid the town  right in the quickest street  
as she was bound to go the way forthright 
toward the garden  there as she had hight  
and he was to the garden ward also  
for well he spied when she woulde go 
out of her house  to any manner place  
but thus they met  of aventure or grace  
and he saluted her with glad intent  
and asked of her whitherward she went  
and she answered  half as she were mad  
 unto the garden  as my husband bade  
my trothe for to hold  alas  alas   
aurelius gan to wonder on this case  
and in his heart had great compassion 
of her  and of her lamentation  
and of arviragus  the worthy knight  
that bade her hold all that she hadde hight  
so loth him was his wife should break her truth 
and in his heart he caught of it great ruth  
considering the best on every side  
that from his lust yet were him lever abide  
than do so high a churlish wretchedness 
against franchise  and alle gentleness  
for which in fewe words he saide thus  
 madame  say to your lord arviragus  
that since i see the greate gentleness 
of him  and eke i see well your distress  
that him were lever have shame and that were ruth 
than ye to me should breake thus your truth  
i had well lever aye to suffer woe  
than to depart the love betwixt you two  
i you release  madame  into your hond  
quit ev ry surement and ev ry bond  ty 
that ye have made to me as herebeforn  
since thilke time that ye were born  
have here my truth  i shall you ne er repreve 
of no behest  and here i take my leave  
as of the truest and the beste wife promise 
that ever yet i knew in all my life  
but every wife beware of her behest  
on dorigen remember at the least  
thus can a squier do a gentle deed  
as well as can a knight  withoute drede   
she thanked him upon her knees bare  
and home unto her husband is she fare  
and told him all  as ye have hearde said  
and  truste me  he was so well apaid  
that it were impossible me to write  
why should i longer of this case indite  
arviragus and dorigen his wife 
in sov reign blisse ledde forth their life  
ne er after was there anger them between  
he cherish d her as though she were a queen  
and she was to him true for evermore  
of these two folk ye get of me no more  
aurelius  that his cost had all forlorn  
cursed the time that ever he was born  
 alas   quoth he   alas that i behight 
of pured gold a thousand pound of weight 
to this philosopher  how shall i do  
i see no more  but that i am fordo  
mine heritage must i needes sell  
and be a beggar  here i will not dwell  
and shamen all my kindred in this place  
but i of him may gette better grace  
but natheless i will of him assay 
at certain dayes year by year to pay  
and thank him of his greate courtesy  
my trothe will i keep  i will not he   
with hearte sore he went unto his coffer  
and broughte gold unto this philosopher  
the value of five hundred pound  i guess  
and him beseeched  of his gentleness  
to grant him dayes of the remenant  
and said   master  i dare well make avaunt  
i failed never of my truth as yet  
for sickerly my debte shall be quit 
towardes you how so that e er i fare 
to go a begging in my kirtle bare  
but would ye vouchesafe  upon surety  
two year  or three  for to respite me  
then were i well  for elles must i sell 
mine heritage  there is no more to tell   
this philosopher soberly answer d  
and saide thus  when he these wordes heard  
 have i not holden covenant to thee   
 yes  certes  well and truely   quoth he  
 hast thou not had thy lady as thee liked   
 no  no   quoth he  and sorrowfully siked  
 what was the cause  tell me if thou can   
aurelius his tale anon began  
and told him all as ye have heard before  
it needeth not to you rehearse it more  
he said   arviragus of gentleness 
had lever die in sorrow and distress  
than that his wife were of her trothe false   
the sorrow of dorigen he told him als   
how loth her was to be a wicked wife  
and that she lever had lost that day her life  
and that her troth she swore through innocence  
she ne er erst had heard speak of apparence 
that made me have of her so great pity  
and right as freely as he sent her to me  
as freely sent i her to him again  
this is all and some  there is no more to sayn   
the philosopher answer d   leve brother  
evereach of you did gently to the other  
thou art a squier  and he is a knight  
but god forbidde  for his blissful might  
but if a clerk could do a gentle deed 
as well as any of you  it is no drede 
sir  i release thee thy thousand pound  
as thou right now were crept out of the ground  
nor ever ere now haddest knowen me  
for  sir  i will not take a penny of thee 
for all my craft  nor naught for my travail  
thou hast y payed well for my vitaille  
it is enough  and farewell  have good day   
and took his horse  and forth he went his way  
lordings  this question would i aske now  
which was the moste free  as thinketh you  
now telle me  ere that ye farther wend  
i can no more  my tale is at an end  
 
the doctor s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
  yea  let that passe   quoth our host   as now  
sir doctor of physik  i praye you  
tell us a tale of some honest mattere   
 it shall be done  if that ye will it hear   
said this doctor  and his tale gan anon  
 now  good men   quoth he   hearken everyone    
 
the tale  
 
there was  as telleth titus livius  
a knight  that called was virginius  
full filled of honour and worthiness  
and strong of friendes  and of great richess  
this knight one daughter hadde by his wife  
no children had he more in all his life  
fair was this maid in excellent beauty 
aboven ev ry wight that man may see  
for nature had with sov reign diligence 
y formed her in so great excellence  
as though she woulde say   lo  i  nature  
thus can i form and paint a creature  
when that me list  who can me counterfeit  
pygmalion  not though he aye forge and beat  
or grave or painte  for i dare well sayn  
apelles  zeuxis  shoulde work in vain  
either to grave  or paint  or forge  or beat  
if they presumed me to counterfeit  
for he that is the former principal  
hath made me his vicar general 
to form and painten earthly creatures 
right as me list  and all thing in my cure is  
under the moone  that may wane and wax  
and for my work right nothing will i ax 
my lord and i be full of one accord  
i made her to the worship of my lord  
so do i all mine other creatures  
what colour that they have  or what figures   
thus seemeth me that nature woulde say  
this maiden was of age twelve year and tway  
in which that nature hadde such delight  
for right as she can paint a lily white  
and red a rose  right with such painture 
she painted had this noble creature  
ere she was born  upon her limbes free  
where as by right such colours shoulde be  
and phoebus dyed had her tresses great  
like to the streames of his burned heat  
and if that excellent was her beauty  
a thousand fold more virtuous was she  
in her there lacked no condition  
that is to praise  as by discretion  
as well in ghost as body chaste was she  
for which she flower d in virginity  
with all humility and abstinence  
with alle temperance and patience  
with measure eke of bearing and array  
discreet she was in answering alway  
though she were wise as pallas  dare i sayn  
her faconde eke full womanly and plain  
no counterfeited termes hadde she 
to seeme wise  but after her degree 
she spake  and all her worde s more and less 
sounding in virtue and in gentleness  
shamefast she was in maiden s shamefastness  
constant in heart  and ever in business 
to drive her out of idle sluggardy  
bacchus had of her mouth right no mast ry  
for wine and slothe do venus increase  
as men in fire will casten oil and grease  
and of her owen virtue  unconstrain d  
she had herself full often sick y feign d  
for that she woulde flee the company  
where likely was to treaten of folly  
as is at feasts  at revels  and at dances  
that be occasions of dalliances  
such thinges make children for to be 
too soone ripe and bold  as men may see  
which is full perilous  and hath been yore  
for all too soone may she learne lore 
of boldeness  when that she is a wife  
and ye mistresses  in your olde life vernesses  duennas 
that lordes  daughters have in governance  
take not of my wordes displeasance 
thinke that ye be set in governings 
of lordes  daughters only for two things  
either for ye have kept your honesty  
or else for ye have fallen in frailty 
and knowe well enough the olde dance  
and have forsaken fully such meschance 
for evermore  therefore  for christe s sake  
to teach them virtue look that ye not slake  
a thief of venison  that hath forlaft 
his lik rousness  and all his olde craft  
can keep a forest best of any man  
now keep them well  for if ye will ye can  
look well  that ye unto no vice assent  
lest ye be damned for your wick  intent  
for whoso doth  a traitor is certain  
and take keep of that i shall you sayn  
of alle treason  sov reign pestilence 
is when a wight betrayeth innocence  
ye fathers  and ye mothers eke also  
though ye have children  be it one or mo   
yours is the charge of all their surveyance  
while that they be under your governance  
beware  that by example of your living  
or by your negligence in chastising  
that they not perish for i dare well say  
if that they do  ye shall it dear abeye  
under a shepherd soft and negligent 
the wolf hath many a sheep and lamb to rent  
suffice this example now as here  
for i must turn again to my mattere  
this maid  of which i tell my tale express  
she kept herself  her needed no mistress  
for in her living maidens mighte read  
as in a book  ev ry good word and deed 
that longeth to a maiden virtuous  
she was so prudent and so bounteous  
for which the fame out sprang on every side 
both of her beauty and her bounte wide  
that through the land they praised her each one 
that loved virtue  save envy alone  
that sorry is of other manne s weal  
and glad is of his sorrow and unheal   
the doctor maketh this descriptioun    
this maiden on a day went in the town 
toward a temple  with her mother dear  
as is of younge maidens the mannere  
now was there then a justice in that town  
that governor was of that regioun  
and so befell  this judge his eyen cast 
upon this maid  avising her full fast  
as she came forth by where this judge stood  
anon his hearte changed and his mood  
so was he caught with beauty of this maid 
and to himself full privily he said  
 this maiden shall be mine for any man   
anon the fiend into his hearte ran  
and taught him suddenly  that he by sleight 
this maiden to his purpose winne might  
for certes  by no force  nor by no meed  
him thought he was not able for to speed  
for she was strong of friendes  and eke she 
confirmed was in such sov reign bounte  
that well he wist he might her never win  
as for to make her with her body sin  
for which  with great deliberatioun  
he sent after a clerk was in the town  
the which he knew for subtle and for bold  
this judge unto this clerk his tale told 
in secret wise  and made him to assure 
he shoulde tell it to no creature  
and if he did  he shoulde lose his head  
and when assented was this cursed rede  
glad was the judge  and made him greate cheer  
and gave him giftes precious and dear  
when shapen was all their conspiracy 
from point to point  how that his lechery 
performed shoulde be full subtilly  
as ye shall hear it after openly  
home went this clerk  that highte claudius  
this false judge  that highte appius    
so was his name  for it is no fable  
but knowen for a storial thing notable  
the sentence of it sooth is out of doubt    
this false judge went now fast about 
to hasten his delight all that he may  
and so befell  soon after on a day  
this false judge  as telleth us the story  
as he was wont  sat in his consistory  
and gave his doomes upon sundry case   
this false clerk came forth a full great pace  
and saide  lord  if that it be your will  
as do me right upon this piteous bill  
in which i plain upon virginius  
and if that he will say it is not thus  
i will it prove  and finde good witness  
that sooth is what my bille will express   
the judge answer d   of this  in his absence  
i may not give definitive sentence  
let do him call  and i will gladly hear  
thou shalt have alle right  and no wrong here   
virginius came to weet the judge s will  
and right anon was read this cursed bill  
the sentence of it was as ye shall hear 
 to you  my lord  sir appius so clear  
sheweth your poore servant claudius  
how that a knight called virginius  
against the law  against all equity  
holdeth  express against the will of me  
my servant  which that is my thrall by right  
which from my house was stolen on a night  
while that she was full young  i will it preve 
by witness  lord  so that it you grieve  
she is his daughter not  what so he say  
wherefore to you  my lord the judge  i pray  
yield me my thrall  if that it be your will   
lo  this was all the sentence of the bill  
virginius gan upon the clerk behold  
but hastily  ere he his tale told  
and would have proved it  as should a knight  
and eke by witnessing of many a wight  
that all was false that said his adversary  
this cursed judge would no longer tarry  
nor hear a word more of virginius  
but gave his judgement  and saide thus  
 i deem anon this clerk his servant have  
thou shalt no longer in thy house her save  
go  bring her forth  and put her in our ward 
the clerk shall have his thrall  thus i award   
and when this worthy knight  virginius  
through sentence of this justice appius  
muste by force his deare daughter give 
unto the judge  in lechery to live  
he went him home  and sat him in his hall  
and let anon his deare daughter call  
and with a face dead as ashes cold 
upon her humble face he gan behold  
with father s pity sticking through his heart  
all would he from his purpose not convert  
 daughter   quoth he   virginia by name  
there be two wayes  either death or shame  
that thou must suffer    alas that i was bore  
for never thou deservedest wherefore 
to dien with a sword or with a knife  
o deare daughter  ender of my life  
whom i have foster d up with such pleasance 
that thou were ne er out of my remembrance  
o daughter  which that art my laste woe  
and in this life my laste joy also  
o gem of chastity  in patience 
take thou thy death  for this is my sentence  
for love and not for hate thou must be dead  
my piteous hand must smiten off thine head  
alas  that ever appius thee say  
thus hath he falsely judged thee to day   
and told her all the case  as ye before 
have heard  it needeth not to tell it more  
 o mercy  deare father   quoth the maid  
and with that word she both her armes laid 
about his neck  as she was wont to do  
the teares burst out of her eyen two  
and said   o goode father  shall i die  
is there no grace  is there no remedy   
 no  certes  deare daughter mine   quoth he  
 then give me leisure  father mine  quoth she  
 my death for to complain a little space 
for  pardie  jephthah gave his daughter grace 
for to complain  ere he her slew  alas  
and  god it wot  nothing was her trespass  
but for she ran her father first to see  
to welcome him with great solemnity   
and with that word she fell a swoon anon  
and after  when her swooning was y gone  
she rose up  and unto her father said  
 blessed be god  that i shall die a maid  
give me my death  ere that i have shame  
do with your child your will  in godde s name   
and with that word she prayed him full oft 
that with his sword he woulde smite her soft  
and with that word  a swoon again she fell  
her father  with full sorrowful heart and fell  
her head off smote  and by the top it hent  
and to the judge he went it to present  
as he sat yet in doom in consistory  
and when the judge it saw  as saith the story  
he bade to take him  and to hang him fast  
but right anon a thousand people in thrast 
to save the knight  for ruth and for pity 
for knowen was the false iniquity  
the people anon had suspect in this thing  
by manner of the clerke s challenging  
that it was by th assent of appius  
they wiste well that he was lecherous  
for which unto this appius they gon  
and cast him in a prison right anon  
where as he slew himself  and claudius  
that servant was unto this appius  
was doomed for to hang upon a tree  
but that virginius  of his pity  
so prayed for him  that he was exil d  
and elles certes had he been beguil d  
the remenant were hanged  more and less  
that were consenting to this cursedness  
here men may see how sin hath his merite  
beware  for no man knows how god will smite 
in no degree  nor in which manner wise 
the worm of conscience may agrise frighten  horrify 
of wicked life  though it so privy be  
that no man knows thereof  save god and he  
for be he lewed man or elles lear d  
he knows not how soon he shall be afear d  
therefore i rede you this counsel take  
forsake sin  ere sinne you forsake  
 
the pardoner s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
our hoste gan to swear as he were wood  
 harow   quoth he   by nailes and by blood  
this was a cursed thief  a false justice  
as shameful death as hearte can devise 
come to these judges and their advoca s  
algate this sely maid is slain  alas  
alas  too deare bought she her beauty  
wherefore i say  that all day man may see 
that giftes of fortune and of nature 
be cause of death to many a creature  
her beauty was her death  i dare well sayn  
alas  so piteously as she was slain  
 of bothe giftes  that i speak of now 
men have full often more harm than prow   
but truely  mine owen master dear  
this was a piteous tale for to hear  
but natheless  pass over   tis no force  
i pray to god to save thy gentle corse  
and eke thine urinals  and thy jordans  
thine hippocras  and eke thy galliens  
and every boist full of thy lectuary  
god bless them  and our lady sainte mary  
so may i the   thou art a proper man  
and like a prelate  by saint ronian  
said i not well  can i not speak in term  
but well i wot thou dost mine heart to erme  
that i have almost caught a cardiacle  
by corpus domini  but i have triacle  
or else a draught of moist and corny ale  
or but i hear anon a merry tale  
mine heart is brost for pity of this maid  
thou bel ami  thou pardoner   he said  
 tell us some mirth of japes right anon   
 it shall be done   quoth he   by saint ronion  
but first   quoth he   here at this ale stake 
i will both drink  and biten on a cake   
but right anon the gentles gan to cry  
 nay  let him tell us of no ribaldry  
tell us some moral thing  that we may lear 
some wit  and thenne will we gladly hear   
 i grant y wis   quoth he   but i must think 
upon some honest thing while that i drink   
 
the tale 
 
lordings quoth he  in churche when i preach  
i paine me to have an hautein speech  
and ring it out  as round as doth a bell  
for i know all by rote that i tell  
my theme is always one  and ever was  
radix malorum est cupiditas  
first i pronounce whence that i come  
and then my bulles shew i all and some  
our liege lorde s seal on my patent  
that shew i first  my body to warrent  
that no man be so hardy  priest nor clerk  
me to disturb of christe s holy werk  
and after that then tell i forth my tales  
bulles of popes  and of cardinales  
of patriarchs  and of bishops i shew  
and in latin i speak a wordes few  
to savour with my predication  
and for to stir men to devotion 
then show i forth my longe crystal stones  
y crammed fall of cloutes and of bones  
relics they be  as weene they each one  
then have i in latoun a shoulder bone 
which that was of a holy jewe s sheep  
 good men   say i   take of my wordes keep  
if that this bone be wash d in any well  
if cow  or calf  or sheep  or oxe swell  
that any worm hath eat  or worm y stung  
take water of that well  and wash his tongue  
and it is whole anon  and farthermore 
of pockes  and of scab  and every sore 
shall every sheep be whole  that of this well 
drinketh a draught  take keep of that i tell  
 if that the goodman  that the beastes oweth  
will every week  ere that the cock him croweth  
fasting  y drinken of this well a draught  
as thilke holy jew our elders taught  
his beastes and his store shall multiply  
and  sirs  also it healeth jealousy  
for though a man be fall n in jealous rage  
let make with this water his pottage  
and never shall he more his wife mistrist  
though he the sooth of her defaulte wist  
all had she taken priestes two or three  
here is a mittain eke  that ye may see  
he that his hand will put in this mittain  
he shall have multiplying of his grain  
when he hath sowen  be it wheat or oats  
so that he offer pence  or elles groats  
and  men and women  one thing warn i you  
if any wight be in this churche now 
that hath done sin horrible  so that he 
dare not for shame of it y shriven be  
or any woman  be she young or old  
that hath y made her husband cokewold  
such folk shall have no power nor no grace 
to offer to my relics in this place  
and whoso findeth him out of such blame  
he will come up and offer in god s name  
and i assoil him by the authority 
which that by bull y granted was to me   
by this gaud have i wonne year by year 
a hundred marks  since i was pardonere  
i stande like a clerk in my pulpit  
and when the lewed people down is set  
i preache so as ye have heard before  
and telle them a hundred japes more  
then pain i me to stretche forth my neck  
and east and west upon the people i beck  
as doth a dove  sitting on a bern  
my handes and my tongue go so yern  
that it is joy to see my business  
of avarice and of such cursedness 
is all my preaching  for to make them free 
to give their pence  and namely unto me  
for mine intent is not but for to win  
and nothing for correction of sin  
i recke never  when that they be buried  
though that their soules go a blackburied  
for certes a predication 
cometh oft time of evil intention  
some for pleasance of folk  and flattery  
to be advanced by hypocrisy  
and some for vainglory  and some for hate  
for  when i dare not otherwise debate  
then will i sting him with my tongue smart 
in preaching  so that he shall not astart 
to be defamed falsely  if that he 
hath trespass d to my brethren or to me  
for  though i telle not his proper name  
men shall well knowe that it is the same 
by signes  and by other circumstances  
thus quite i folk that do us displeasances  
thus spit i out my venom  under hue 
of holiness  to seem holy and true  
but  shortly mine intent i will devise  
i preach of nothing but of covetise  
therefore my theme is yet  and ever was    
radix malorum est cupiditas  
thus can i preach against the same vice 
which that i use  and that is avarice  
but though myself be guilty in that sin  
yet can i maken other folk to twin 
from avarice  and sore them repent  
but that is not my principal intent  
i preache nothing but for covetise  
of this mattere it ought enough suffice  
then tell i them examples many a one  
of olde stories longe time gone  
for lewed people love tales old  
such thinges can they well report and hold  
what  trowe ye  that whiles i may preach 
and winne gold and silver for i teach  
that i will live in povert  wilfully  
nay  nay  i thought it never truely  
for i will preach and beg in sundry lands  
i will not do no labour with mine hands  
nor make baskets for to live thereby  
because i will not beggen idlely  
i will none of the apostles counterfeit  
i will have money  wool  and cheese  and wheat  
all were it given of the poorest page  
or of the pooreste widow in a village  
all should her children sterve for famine  
nay  i will drink the liquor of the vine  
and have a jolly wench in every town  
but hearken  lordings  in conclusioun  
your liking is  that i shall tell a tale 
now i have drunk a draught of corny ale  
by god  i hope i shall you tell a thing 
that shall by reason be to your liking  
for though myself be a full vicious man  
a moral tale yet i you telle can  
which i am wont to preache  for to win  
now hold your peace  my tale i will begin  
in flanders whilom was a company 
of younge folkes  that haunted folly  
as riot  hazard  stewes  and taverns  
where as with lutes  harpes  and giterns  
they dance and play at dice both day and night  
and eat also  and drink over their might  
through which they do the devil sacrifice 
within the devil s temple  in cursed wise  
by superfluity abominable  
their oathes be so great and so damnable  
that it is grisly for to hear them swear 
our blissful lorde s body they to tear  
them thought the jewes rent him not enough  
and each of them at other s sinne lough  
and right anon in come tombesteres 
fetis and small  and younge fruitesteres  
singers with harpes  baudes  waferers  
which be the very devil s officers  
to kindle and blow the fire of lechery  
that is annexed unto gluttony  
the holy writ take i to my witness  
that luxury is in wine and drunkenness  
lo  how that drunken lot unkindely ly 
lay by his daughters two unwittingly  
so drunk he was he knew not what he wrought  
herodes  who so well the stories sought  
when he of wine replete was at his feast  
right at his owen table gave his hest 
to slay the baptist john full guilteless  
seneca saith a good word  doubteless  
he saith he can no difference find 
betwixt a man that is out of his mind  
and a man whiche that is drunkelew  
but that woodness  y fallen in a shrew  
persevereth longer than drunkenness  
o gluttony  full of all cursedness  
o cause first of our confusion  
original of our damnation  
till christ had bought us with his blood again  
looke  how deare  shortly for to sayn  
abought was first this cursed villainy  
corrupt was all this world for gluttony  
adam our father  and his wife also  
from paradise  to labour and to woe  
were driven for that vice  it is no dread  
for while that adam fasted  as i read  
he was in paradise  and when that he 
ate of the fruit defended of the tree  
anon he was cast out to woe and pain  
o gluttony  well ought us on thee plain  
oh  wist a man how many maladies 
follow of excess and of gluttonies  
he woulde be the more measurable 
of his diete  sitting at his table  
alas  the shorte throat  the tender mouth  
maketh that east and west  and north and south  
in earth  in air  in water  men do swink 
to get a glutton dainty meat and drink  
of this mattere  o paul  well canst thou treat 
meat unto womb  and womb eke unto meat  
shall god destroye both  as paulus saith  
alas  a foul thing is it  by my faith  
to say this word  and fouler is the deed  
when man so drinketh of the white and red  
that of his throat he maketh his privy 
through thilke cursed superfluity 
the apostle saith  weeping full piteously  
there walk many  of which you told have i    
i say it now weeping with piteous voice    
that they be enemies of christe s crois  
of which the end is death  womb is their god  
o womb  o belly  stinking is thy cod  
full fill d of dung and of corruptioun  
at either end of thee foul is the soun  
how great labour and cost is thee to find  
these cookes how they stamp  and strain  and grind  
and turne substance into accident  
to fulfill all thy likerous talent  
out of the harde bones knocke they 
the marrow  for they caste naught away 
that may go through the gullet soft and swoot 
of spicery and leaves  of bark and root  
shall be his sauce y maked by delight  
to make him have a newer appetite  
but  certes  he that haunteth such delices 
is dead while that he liveth in those vices  
a lecherous thing is wine  and drunkenness 
is full of striving and of wretchedness  
o drunken man  disfgur d is thy face  
sour is thy breath  foul art thou to embrace  
and through thy drunken nose sowneth the soun   
as though thous saidest aye  samsoun  samsoun  
and yet  god wot  samson drank never wine  
thou fallest as it were a sticked swine  
thy tongue is lost  and all thine honest cure  
for drunkenness is very sepulture 
of manne s wit and his discretion  
in whom that drink hath domination  
he can no counsel keep  it is no dread  
now keep you from the white and from the red  
and namely from the white wine of lepe  
that is to sell in fish street and in cheap  
this wine of spaine creepeth subtilly   
in other wines growing faste by  
of which there riseth such fumosity  
that when a man hath drunken draughtes three  
and weeneth that he be at home in cheap  
he is in spain  right at the town of lepe  
not at the rochelle  nor at bourdeaux town  
and thenne will he say  samsoun  samsoun  
but hearken  lordings  one word  i you pray  
that all the sovreign actes  dare i say  
of victories in the old testament  
through very god that is omnipotent  
were done in abstinence and in prayere  
look in the bible  and there ye may it lear  
look  attila  the greate conqueror  
died in his sleep  with shame and dishonour  
bleeding aye at his nose in drunkenness  
a captain should aye live in soberness 
and o er all this  advise you right well 
what was commanded unto lemuel  
not samuel  but lemuel  say i  
reade the bible  and find it expressly 
of wine giving to them that have justice  
no more of this  for it may well suffice  
and  now that i have spoke of gluttony  
now will i you defende hazardry  
hazard is very mother of leasings  
and of deceit  and cursed forswearings  
blasphem  of christ  manslaughter  and waste also 
of chattel and of time  and furthermo  
it is repreve  and contrar  of honour  
for to be held a common hazardour  
and ever the higher he is of estate  
the more he is holden desolate  
if that a prince use hazardry  
in alle governance and policy 
he is  as by common opinion  
y hold the less in reputation  
chilon  that was a wise ambassador  
was sent to corinth with full great honor 
from lacedemon  to make alliance  
and when he came  it happen d him  by chance  
that all the greatest that were of that land  
y playing atte hazard he them fand  
for which  as soon as that it mighte be  
he stole him home again to his country 
and saide there   i will not lose my name  
nor will i take on me so great diffame  
you to ally unto no hazardors  
sende some other wise ambassadors  
for  by my troth  me were lever die  
than i should you to hazardors ally  
for ye  that be so glorious in honours  
shall not ally you to no hazardours  
as by my will  nor as by my treaty   
this wise philosopher thus said he  
look eke how to the king demetrius 
the king of parthes  as the book saith us  
sent him a pair of dice of gold in scorn  
for he had used hazard therebeforn  
for which he held his glory and renown 
at no value or reputatioun  
lordes may finden other manner play 
honest enough to drive the day away  
now will i speak of oathes false and great 
a word or two  as olde bookes treat  
great swearing is a thing abominable  
and false swearing is more reprovable  
the highe god forbade swearing at all  
witness on matthew  but in special 
of swearing saith the holy jeremie  
thou thalt swear sooth thine oathes  and not lie  
and swear in doom and eke in righteousness  
but idle swearing is a cursedness  
behold and see  there in the firste table 
of highe godde s hestes honourable  ments 
how that the second best of him is this  
take not my name in idle or amiss  
lo  rather he forbiddeth such swearing  
than homicide  or many a cursed thing  
i say that as by order thus it standeth  
this knoweth he that his hests understandeth  ments 
how that the second hest of god is that  
and farthermore  i will thee tell all plat  
that vengeance shall not parte from his house  
that of his oathes is outrageous  
 by godde s precious heart  and by his nails  
and by the blood of christ  that is in hailes  
seven is my chance  and thine is cinque and trey  
by godde s armes  if thou falsely play  
this dagger shall throughout thine hearte go   
this fruit comes of the bicched bones two  
forswearing  ire  falseness  and homicide  
now  for the love of christ that for us died  
leave your oathes  bothe great and smale  
but  sirs  now will i ell you forth my tale  
these riotoures three  of which i tell  
long erst than prime rang of any bell  
were set them in a tavern for to drink  
and as they sat  they heard a belle clink 
before a corpse  was carried to the grave  
that one of them gan calle to his knave  
 go bet   quoth he   and aske readily 
what corpse is this  that passeth here forth by  
and look that thou report his name well   
 sir   quoth the boy   it needeth never a deal  
it was me told ere ye came here two hours  
he was  pardie  an old fellow of yours  
and suddenly he was y slain to night  
fordrunk as he sat on his bench upright  ly drunk 
there came a privy thief  men clepe death  
that in this country all the people slay th  
and with his spear he smote his heart in two  
and went his way withoute wordes mo   
he hath a thousand slain this pestilence  
and  master  ere you come in his presence  
me thinketh that it were full necessary 
for to beware of such an adversary  
be ready for to meet him evermore  
thus taughte me my dame  i say no more   
 by sainte mary   said the tavernere  
 the child saith sooth  for he hath slain this year  
hence ov r a mile  within a great village  
both man and woman  child  and hind  and page  
i trow his habitation be there  
to be advised great wisdom it were  ful  on one s guard 
ere that he did a man a dishonour   
 yea  godde s armes   quoth this riotour  
 is it such peril with him for to meet  
i shall him seek  by stile and eke by street  
i make a vow  by godde s digne bones   
hearken  fellows  we three be alle ones  
let each of us hold up his hand to other  
and each of us become the other s brother  
and we will slay this false traitor death  
he shall be slain  he that so many slay th  
by godde s dignity  ere it be night   
together have these three their trothe plight 
to live and die each one of them for other 
as though he were his owen sworen brother  
and up they start  all drunken  in this rage  
and forth they go towardes that village 
of which the taverner had spoke beforn  
and many a grisly oathe have they sworn  
and christe s blessed body they to rent  
 death shall be dead  if that we may him hent   
when they had gone not fully half a mile  
right as they would have trodden o er a stile  
an old man and a poore with them met  
this olde man full meekely them gret  
and saide thus   now  lordes  god you see   
the proudest of these riotoures three 
answer d again   what  churl  with sorry grace  
why art thou all forwrapped save thy face  
why livest thou so long in so great age   
this olde man gan look on his visage  
and saide thus   for that i cannot find 
a man  though that i walked unto ind  
neither in city  nor in no village go  
that woulde change his youthe for mine age  
and therefore must i have mine age still 
as longe time as it is godde s will  
and death  alas  he will not have my life  
thus walk i like a resteless caitife  
and on the ground  which is my mother s gate  
i knocke with my staff  early and late  
and say to her   leve mother  let me in  
lo  how i wane  flesh  and blood  and skin  
alas  when shall my bones be at rest  
mother  with you i woulde change my chest  
that in my chamber longe time hath be  
yea  for an hairy clout to wrap in me   
but yet to me she will not do that grace  
for which fall pale and welked is my face  
but  sirs  to you it is no courtesy 
to speak unto an old man villainy  
but he trespass in word or else in deed  
in holy writ ye may yourselves read  
 against an old man  hoar upon his head  
ye should arise   therefore i you rede  
ne do unto an old man no harm now  
no more than ye would a man did you 
in age  if that ye may so long abide  
and god be with you  whether ye go or ride 
i must go thither as i have to go   
 nay  olde churl  by god thou shalt not so   
saide this other hazardor anon  
 thou partest not so lightly  by saint john  
thou spakest right now of that traitor death  
that in this country all our friendes slay th  
have here my troth  as thou art his espy  
tell where he is  or thou shalt it abie  
by god and by the holy sacrament  
for soothly thou art one of his assent 
to slay us younge folk  thou false thief   
 now  sirs   quoth he   if it be you so lief 
to finde death  turn up this crooked way  
for in that grove i left him  by my fay  
under a tree  and there he will abide  
nor for your boast he will him nothing hide  
see ye that oak  right there ye shall him find  
god save you  that bought again mankind  
and you amend   thus said this olde man  
and evereach of these riotoures ran  
till they came to the tree  and there they found 
of florins fine  of gold y coined round  
well nigh a seven bushels  as them thought  
no longer as then after death they sought  
but each of them so glad was of the sight  
for that the florins were so fair and bright  
that down they sat them by the precious hoard  
the youngest of them spake the firste word  
 brethren   quoth he    keep what i shall say  
my wit is great  though that i bourde and play 
this treasure hath fortune unto us given 
in mirth and jollity our life to liven  
and lightly as it comes  so will we spend  
hey  godde s precious dignity  who wend 
today that we should have so fair a grace  
but might this gold he carried from this place 
home to my house  or elles unto yours 
for well i wot that all this gold is ours  
then were we in high felicity  
but truely by day it may not be  
men woulde say that we were thieves strong  
and for our owen treasure do us hong  
this treasure muste carried be by night  
as wisely and as slily as it might  
wherefore i rede  that cut among us all 
we draw  and let see where the cut will fall  
and he that hath the cut  with hearte blithe 
shall run unto the town  and that full swithe  
and bring us bread and wine full privily  
and two of us shall keepe subtilly 
this treasure well  and if he will not tarry  
when it is night  we will this treasure carry  
by one assent  where as us thinketh best   
then one of them the cut brought in his fist  
and bade them draw  and look where it would fall  
and it fell on the youngest of them all  
and forth toward the town he went anon  
and all so soon as that he was y gone  
the one of them spake thus unto the other  
 thou knowest well that thou art my sworn brother  
thy profit will i tell thee right anon  
thou knowest well that our fellow is gone  advantage 
and here is gold  and that full great plenty  
that shall departed he among us three  
but natheless  if i could shape it so 
that it departed were among us two  
had i not done a friende s turn to thee   
th  other answer d   i n ot how that may be  
he knows well that the gold is with us tway  
what shall we do  what shall we to him say   
 shall it be counsel   said the firste shrew  
 and i shall tell to thee in wordes few 
what we shall do  and bring it well about   
 i grante   quoth the other   out of doubt  
that by my truth i will thee not bewray   
 now   quoth the first   thou know st well we be tway  
and two of us shall stronger be than one  
look  when that he is set  thou right anon 
arise  as though thou wouldest with him play  
and i shall rive him through the sides tway  
while that thou strugglest with him as in game  
and with thy dagger look thou do the same  
and then shall all this gold departed be  
my deare friend  betwixte thee and me  
then may we both our lustes all fulfil  
and play at dice right at our owen will   
and thus accorded be these shrewes tway 
to slay the third  as ye have heard me say  
the youngest  which that wente to the town  
full oft in heart he rolled up and down 
the beauty of these florins new and bright  
 o lord   quoth he   if so were that i might 
have all this treasure to myself alone  
there is no man that lives under the throne 
of god  that shoulde have so merry as i   
and at the last the fiend our enemy 
put in his thought  that he should poison buy  
with which he mighte slay his fellows twy  
for why  the fiend found him in such living  
that he had leave to sorrow him to bring  
for this was utterly his full intent 
to slay them both  and never to repent  
and forth he went  no longer would he tarry  
into the town to an apothecary  
and prayed him that he him woulde sell 
some poison  that he might his rattes quell  
and eke there was a polecat in his haw  
that  as he said  his eapons had y slaw  
and fain he would him wreak  if that he might  
of vermin that destroyed him by night  
th apothecary answer d   thou shalt have 
a thing  as wisly god my soule save  
in all this world there is no creature 
that eat or drank hath of this confecture  
not but the mountance of a corn of wheat  
that he shall not his life anon forlete  
yea  sterve he shall  and that in lesse while 
than thou wilt go apace nought but a mile  
this poison is so strong and violent   
this cursed man hath in his hand y hent 
this poison in a box  and swift he ran 
into the nexte street  unto a man  
and borrow d of him large bottles three  
and in the two the poison poured he  
the third he kepte clean for his own drink  
for all the night he shope him for to swink 
in carrying off the gold out of that place  
and when this riotour  with sorry grace  
had fill d with wine his greate bottles three  
to his fellows again repaired he  
what needeth it thereof to sermon more  
for  right as they had cast his death before  
right so they have him slain  and that anon  
and when that this was done  thus spake the one  
 now let us sit and drink  and make us merry  
and afterward we will his body bury   
and with that word it happen d him par cas 
to take the bottle where the poison was  
and drank  and gave his fellow drink also  
for which anon they sterved both the two  
but certes i suppose that avicen 
wrote never in no canon  nor no fen  
more wondrous signes of empoisoning  
than had these wretches two ere their ending  
thus ended be these homicides two  
and eke the false empoisoner also  
o cursed sin  full of all cursedness  
o trait rous homicide  o wickedness  
o glutt ny  luxury  and hazardry  
thou blasphemer of christ with villany  
and oathes great  of usage and of pride  
alas  mankinde  how may it betide  
that to thy creator  which that thee wrought  
and with his precious hearte blood thee bought  
thou art so false and so unkind  alas  
now  good men  god forgive you your trespass  
and ware you from the sin of avarice  
mine holy pardon may you all warice  
so that ye offer nobles or sterlings  
or elles silver brooches  spoons  or rings  
bowe your head under this holy bull  
come up  ye wives  and offer of your will  
your names i enter in my roll anon  
into the bliss of heaven shall ye gon  
i you assoil by mine high powere  
you that will offer  as clean and eke as clear 
as ye were born  lo  sires  thus i preach  
and jesus christ  that is our soules  leech  
so grante you his pardon to receive  
for that is best  i will not deceive  
but  sirs  one word forgot i in my tale  
i have relics and pardon in my mail  
as fair as any man in engleland  
which were me given by the pope s hand  
if any of you will of devotion 
offer  and have mine absolution  
come forth anon  and kneele here adown 
and meekely receive my pardoun  
or elles take pardon  as ye wend  
all new and fresh at every towne s end  
so that ye offer  always new and new  
nobles or pence which that be good and true  
 tis an honour to evereach that is here  
that ye have a suffisant pardonere 
t assoile you in country as ye ride  
for aventures which that may betide  
paraventure there may fall one or two 
down of his horse  and break his neck in two  
look  what a surety is it to you all  
that i am in your fellowship y fall  
that may assoil you bothe more and lass  
when that the soul shall from the body pass  
i rede that our hoste shall begin  
for he is most enveloped in sin  
come forth  sir host  and offer first anon  
and thou shalt kiss  the relics every one  
yea  for a groat  unbuckle anon thy purse  
 nay  nay   quoth he   then have i christe s curse  
let be   quoth he   it shall not be  so the ch  
thou wouldest make me kiss thine olde breech  
and swear it were a relic of a saint  
though it were with thy fundament depaint   
but  by the cross which that saint helen fand  
i would i had thy coilons in mine hand  
instead of relics  or of sanctuary  
let cut them off  i will thee help them carry  
they shall be shrined in a hogge s turd   
the pardoner answered not one word  
so wroth he was  no worde would he say  
 now   quoth our host   i will no longer play 
with thee  nor with none other angry man   
but right anon the worthy knight began 
when that he saw that all the people lough  
 no more of this  for it is right enough  
sir pardoner  be merry and glad of cheer  
and ye  sir host  that be to me so dear  
i pray you that ye kiss the pardoner  
and  pardoner  i pray thee draw thee ner  
and as we didde  let us laugh and play   
anon they kiss d  and rode forth their way  
 
the shipman s tale  
 
the prologue 
 
our host upon his stirrups stood anon  
and saide   good men  hearken every one  
this was a thrifty tale for the nones  
sir parish priest   quoth he   for godde s bones  
tell us a tale  as was thy forword yore  
i see well that ye learned men in lore 
can muche good  by godde s dignity   
the parson him answer d   ben dicite  
what ails the man  so sinfully to swear   
our host answer d   o jankin  be ye there  
now  good men   quoth our host   hearken to me  
i smell a lollard in the wind   quoth he  
 abide  for godde s digne passion  
for we shall have a predication  
this lollard here will preachen us somewhat   
 nay  by my father s soul  that shall he not  
saide the shipman   here shall he not preach  
he shall no gospel glose here nor teach  
we all believe in the great god   quoth he  
 he woulde sowe some difficulty  
or springe cockle in our cleane corn  
and therefore  host  i warne thee beforn  
my jolly body shall a tale tell  
and i shall clinke you so merry a bell  
that i shall waken all this company  
but it shall not be of philosophy  
nor of physic  nor termes quaint of law  
there is but little latin in my maw   
 
the tale  
 
a merchant whilom dwell d at saint denise  
that riche was  for which men held him wise  
a wife he had of excellent beauty  
and companiable and revellous was she  
which is a thing that causeth more dispence merry making 
than worth is all the cheer and reverence 
that men them do at feastes and at dances  
such salutations and countenances 
passen  as doth the shadow on the wall  
put woe is him that paye must for all  
the sely husband algate he must pay  
he must us clothe and he must us array 
all for his owen worship richely  
in which array we dance jollily  
and if that he may not  paraventure  
or elles list not such dispence endure  
but thinketh it is wasted and y lost  
then must another paye for our cost  
or lend us gold  and that is perilous  
this noble merchant held a noble house  
for which he had all day so great repair  
for his largesse  and for his wife was fair  
that wonder is  but hearken to my tale  
amonges all these guestes great and smale  
there was a monk  a fair man and a bold  
i trow a thirty winter he was old  
that ever in one was drawing to that place  
this younge monk  that was so fair of face  
acquainted was so with this goode man  
since that their firste knowledge began  
that in his house as familiar was he 
as it is possible any friend to be  
and  for as muchel as this goode man  
and eke this monk of which that i began  
were both the two y born in one village  
the monk him claimed  as for cousinage  
and he again him said not once nay  with him 
but was as glad thereof as fowl of day  
 for to his heart it was a great pleasance  
thus be they knit with etern  alliance  
and each of them gan other to assure 
of brotherhood while that their life may dure  
free was dan john  and namely of dispence  
as in that house  and full of diligence 
to do pleasance  and also great costage  
he not forgot to give the leaste page 
in all that house  but  after their degree  
he gave the lord  and sithen his meinie  
when that he came  some manner honest thing  
for which they were as glad of his coming 
as fowl is fain when that the sun upriseth  
no more of this as now  for it sufficeth  
but so befell  this merchant on a day 
shope him to make ready his array 
toward the town of bruges for to fare  
to buye there a portion of ware  
for which he hath to paris sent anon 
a messenger  and prayed hath dan john 
that he should come to saint denis  and play 
with him  and with his wife  a day or tway  
ere he to bruges went  in alle wise  
this noble monk  of which i you devise  
had of his abbot  as him list  licence  
because he was a man of high prudence  
and eke an officer out for to ride  
to see their granges and their barnes wide  
and unto saint denis he came anon  
who was so welcome as my lord dan john  
our deare cousin  full of courtesy  
with him he brought a jub of malvesie  
and eke another full of fine vernage  
and volatile  as aye was his usage  
and thus i let them eat  and drink  and play  
this merchant and this monk  a day or tway  
the thirde day the merchant up ariseth  
and on his needeis sadly him adviseth  
and up into his countour house went he  
to reckon with himself as well may be  
of thilke year  how that it with him stood  
and how that he dispended bad his good  
and if that he increased were or non  
his bookes and his bagges many a one 
he laid before him on his counting board  
full riche was his treasure and his hoard  
for which full fast his countour door he shet  
and eke he would that no man should him let 
of his accountes  for the meane time  
and thus he sat  till it was passed prime  
dan john was risen in the morn also  
and in the garden walked to and fro  
and had his thinges said full courteously  
the good wife came walking full privily 
into the garden  where he walked soft  
and him saluted  as she had done oft  
a maiden child came in her company  
which as her list she might govern and gie  
for yet under the yarde was the maid  
 o deare cousin mine  dan john   she said  
 what aileth you so rath for to arise   
 niece   quoth he   it ought enough suffice 
five houres for to sleep upon a night   
but it were for an old appalled wight  
as be these wedded men  that lie and dare  
as in a forme sits a weary hare  
alle forstraught with houndes great and smale  
but  deare niece  why be ye so pale  
i trowe certes that our goode man 
hath you so laboured  since this night began  
that you were need to reste hastily   
and with that word he laugh d full merrily  
and of his owen thought he wax d all red  
this faire wife gan for to shake her head  
and saide thus   yea  god wot all  quoth she  
 nay  cousin mine  it stands not so with me  
for by that god  that gave me soul and life  
in all the realm of france is there no wife 
that lesse lust hath to that sorry play  
for i may sing alas and well away  
that i was born  but to no wight   quoth she  
 dare i not tell how that it stands with me  
wherefore i think out of this land to wend  
or elles of myself to make an end  
so full am i of dread and eke of care   
this monk began upon this wife to stare  
and said   alas  my niece  god forbid 
that ye for any sorrow  or any dread  
fordo yourself  but telle me your grief  
paraventure i may  in your mischief  
counsel or help  and therefore telle me 
all your annoy  for it shall be secre  
for on my portos here i make an oath  
that never in my life  for lief nor loth  
ne shall i of no counsel you bewray   
 the same again to you   quoth she   i say  
by god and by this portos i you swear  
though men me woulden all in pieces tear  
ne shall i never  for to go to hell  
bewray one word of thing that ye me tell  
for no cousinage  nor alliance  
but verily for love and affiance   
thus be they sworn  and thereupon they kiss d  
and each of them told other what them list  
 cousin   quoth she   if that i hadde space  
as i have none  and namely in this place  
then would i tell a legend of my life  
what i have suffer d since i was a wife 
with mine husband  all be he your cousin  
 nay   quoth this monk   by god and saint martin  
he is no more cousin unto me  
than is the leaf that hangeth on the tree  
i call him so  by saint denis of france  
to have the more cause of acquaintance 
of you  which i have loved specially 
aboven alle women sickerly  
this swear i you on my professioun  
tell me your grief  lest that he come adown  
and hasten you  and go away anon   
 my deare love   quoth she   o my dan john  
full lief were me this counsel for to hide  
but out it must  i may no more abide  
my husband is to me the worste man 
that ever was since that the world began  
but since i am a wife  it sits not me 
to telle no wight of our privity  
neither in bed  nor in none other place  
god shield i shoulde tell it for his grace  
a wife shall not say of her husband 
but all honour  as i can understand  
save unto you thus much i telle shall  
as help me god  he is nought worth at all 
in no degree  the value of a fly  
but yet me grieveth most his niggardy  
and well ye wot  that women naturally 
desire thinges six  as well as i  
they woulde that their husbands shoulde be 
hardy  and wise  and rich  and thereto free  
and buxom to his wife  and fresh in bed  
but  by that ilke lord that for us bled  
for his honour myself for to array  
on sunday next i muste needes pay 
a hundred francs  or elles am i lorn  
yet were me lever that i were unborn  
than me were done slander or villainy  
and if mine husband eke might it espy  
i were but lost  and therefore i you pray  
lend me this sum  or elles must i dey  
dan john  i say  lend me these hundred francs  
pardie  i will not faile you  my thanks  
if that you list to do that i you pray  
for at a certain day i will you pay  
and do to you what pleasance and service 
that i may do  right as you list devise  
and but i do  god take on me vengeance  
as foul as e er had ganilion of france   
this gentle monk answer d in this mannere  
 now truely  mine owen lady dear  
i have   quoth he   on you so greate ruth  
that i you swear  and plighte you my truth  
that when your husband is to flanders fare  
i will deliver you out of this care  
for i will bringe you a hundred francs   
and with that word he caught her by the flanks  
and her embraced hard  and kissed her oft  
 go now your way   quoth he   all still and soft  
and let us dine as soon as that ye may  
for by my cylinder  tis prime of day  
go now  and be as true as i shall be   
 now elles god forbidde  sir   quoth she  
and forth she went  as jolly as a pie  
and bade the cookes that they should them hie  
so that men mighte dine  and that anon  
up to her husband is this wife gone  
and knocked at his contour boldely  
 qui est la   quoth he   peter  it am i   
quoth she   what  sir  how longe all will ye fast  
how longe time will ye reckon and cast 
your summes  and your bookes  and your things  
the devil have part of all such reckonings  
ye have enough  pardie  of godde s sond  
come down to day  and let your bagges stond  
ne be ye not ashamed  that dan john 
shall fasting all this day elenge gon  
what  let us hear a mass  and go we dine   
 wife   quoth this man   little canst thou divine 
the curious businesse that we have  
for of us chapmen  all so god me save  
and by that lord that cleped is saint ive  
scarcely amonges twenty  ten shall thrive 
continually  lasting unto our age  
we may well make cheer and good visage  
and drive forth the world as it may be  
and keepen our estate in privity  
till we be dead  or elles that we play 
a pilgrimage  or go out of the way  
and therefore have i great necessity 
upon this quaint world to advise me  
for evermore must we stand in dread 
of hap and fortune in our chapmanhead  
to flanders will i go to morrow at day  
and come again as soon as e er i may  
for which  my deare wife  i thee beseek 
as be to every wight buxom and meek  
and for to keep our good be curious  
and honestly governe well our house  
thou hast enough  in every manner wise  
that to a thrifty household may suffice  
thee lacketh none array  nor no vitail  
of silver in thy purse thou shalt not fail   
and with that word his contour door he shet  
and down he went  no longer would he let  
and hastily a mass was there said  
and speedily the tables were laid  
and to the dinner faste they them sped  
and richely this monk the chapman fed  
and after dinner dan john soberly 
this chapman took apart  and privily 
he said him thus   cousin  it standeth so  
that  well i see  to bruges ye will go  
god and saint austin speede you and guide  
i pray you  cousin  wisely that ye ride  
governe you also of your diet 
attemperly  and namely in this heat  
betwixt us two needeth no fare  
farewell  cousin  god shielde you from care  
if any thing there be  by day or night  
if it lie in my power and my might  
that ye me will command in any wise  
it shall be done  right as ye will devise  
but one thing ere ye go  if it may be  
i woulde pray you for to lend to me 
a hundred frankes  for a week or twy  
for certain beastes that i muste buy  
to store with a place that is ours 
god help me so  i would that it were yours  
i shall not faile surely of my day  
not for a thousand francs  a mile way  
but let this thing be secret  i you pray  
for yet to night these beastes must i buy  
and fare now well  mine owen cousin dear  
grand mercy of your cost and of your cheer   
this noble merchant gentilly anon 
answer d and said   o cousin mine  dan john  
now sickerly this is a small request  
my gold is youres  when that it you lest  
and not only my gold  but my chaffare  
take what you list  god shielde that ye spare  
but one thing is  ye know it well enow should take too little 
of chapmen  that their money is their plough  
we may creance while we have a name  
but goldless for to be it is no game  
pay it again when it lies in your ease  
after my might full fain would i you please   
these hundred frankes set he forth anon  
and privily he took them to dan john  
no wight in all this world wist of this loan  
saving the merchant and dan john alone  
they drink  and speak  and roam a while  and play  
till that dan john rode unto his abbay  
the morrow came  and forth this merchant rideth 
to flanders ward  his prentice well him guideth  
till he came unto bruges merrily  
now went this merchant fast and busily 
about his need  and buyed and creanced  
he neither played at the dice  nor danced  
but as a merchant  shortly for to tell  
he led his life  and there i let him dwell  
the sunday next the merchant was y gone  
to saint denis y comen is dan john  
with crown and beard all fresh and newly shave  
in all the house was not so little a knave  
nor no wight elles that was not full fain 
for that my lord dan john was come again  
and shortly to the point right for to gon  
the faire wife accorded with dan john  
that for these hundred francs he should all night 
have her in his armes bolt upright  
and this accord performed was in deed  
in mirth all night a busy life they lead  
till it was day  that dan john went his way  
and bade the meinie  farewell  have good day   
for none of them  nor no wight in the town  
had of dan john right no suspicioun  
and forth he rode home to his abbay  
or where him list  no more of him i say  
the merchant  when that ended was the fair  
to saint denis he gan for to repair  
and with his wife he made feast and cheer  
and tolde her that chaffare was so dear  
that needes must he make a chevisance  
for he was bound in a recognisance 
to paye twenty thousand shields anon  
for which this merchant is to paris gone  
to borrow of certain friendes that he had 
a certain francs  and some with him he lad  
and when that he was come into the town  
for great cherte and great affectioun 
unto dan john he wente first to play  
not for to borrow of him no money  
bat for to weet and see of his welfare  
and for to telle him of his chaffare  
as friendes do  when they be met in fere  
dan john him made feast and merry cheer  
and he him told again full specially  
how he had well y bought and graciously 
thanked be god all whole his merchandise  
save that he must  in alle manner wise  
maken a chevisance  as for his best  
and then he shoulde be in joy and rest  
dan john answered   certes  i am fain 
that ye in health be come borne again  
and if that i were rich  as have i bliss  
of twenty thousand shields should ye not miss  
for ye so kindely the other day 
lente me gold  and as i can and may 
i thanke you  by god and by saint jame  
but natheless i took unto our dame  
your wife at home  the same gold again  
upon your bench  she wot it well  certain  
by certain tokens that i can her tell 
now  by your leave  i may no longer dwell  
our abbot will out of this town anon  
and in his company i muste gon  
greet well our dame  mine owen niece sweet  
and farewell  deare cousin  till we meet  
this merchant  which that was full ware and wise  
creanced hath  and paid eke in paris 
to certain lombards ready in their hond 
the sum of gold  and got of them his bond  
and home he went  merry as a popinjay  
for well he knew he stood in such array 
that needes must he win in that voyage 
a thousand francs  above all his costage  
his wife full ready met him at the gate  
as she was wont of old usage algate 
and all that night in mirthe they beset  
for he was rich  and clearly out of debt  
when it was day  the merchant gan embrace 
his wife all new  and kiss d her in her face  
and up he went  and maked it full tough  
 no more   quoth she   by god ye have enough   
and wantonly again with him she play d  
till at the last this merchant to her said  
 by god   quoth he   i am a little wroth 
with you  my wife  although it be me loth  
and wot ye why  by god  as that i guess  
that ye have made a manner strangeness 
betwixte me and my cousin  dan john  
ye should have warned me  ere i had gone  
that he you had a hundred frankes paid 
by ready token  he had him evil apaid 
for that i to him spake of chevisance  
he seemed so as by his countenance  
but natheless  by god of heaven king  
i thoughte not to ask of him no thing  
i pray thee  wife  do thou no more so  
tell me alway  ere that i from thee go  
if any debtor hath in mine absence 
y payed thee  lest through thy negligence 
i might him ask a thing that he hath paid   
this wife was not afeared nor afraid  
but boldely she said  and that anon  
 mary  i defy that false monk dan john  
i keep not of his tokens never a deal  
he took me certain gold  i wot it well    
what  evil thedom on his monke s snout    
for  god it wot  i ween d withoute doubt 
that he had given it me  because of you  
to do therewith mine honour and my prow  
for cousinage  and eke for belle cheer 
that he hath had full often here  
but since i see i stand in such disjoint  
i will answer you shortly to the point  
ye have more slacke debtors than am i  
for i will pay you well and readily  
from day to day  and if so be i fail  
i am your wife  score it upon my tail  
and i shall pay as soon as ever i may  
for  by my troth  i have on mine array  
and not in waste  bestow d it every deal  
and  for i have bestowed it so well  
for your honour  for godde s sake i say  
as be not wroth  but let us laugh and play  
ye shall my jolly body have to wed  
by god  i will not pay you but in bed  
forgive it me  mine owen spouse dear  
turn hitherward  and make better cheer   
the merchant saw none other remedy  
and for to chide  it were but a folly  
since that the thing might not amended be  
 now  wife   he said   and i forgive it thee  
but by thy life be no more so large  
keep better my good  this give i thee in charge   
thus endeth now my tale  and god us send 
taling enough  until our lives  end  
 
the prioress s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
 well said  by corpus domini   quoth our host  
 now longe may st thou saile by the coast  
thou gentle master  gentle marinere  
god give the monk a thousand last quad year  
aha  fellows  beware of such a jape  
the monk put in the manne s hood an ape  
and in his wife s eke  by saint austin  
drawe no monkes more into your inn  
but now pass over  and let us seek about  
who shall now telle first of all this rout 
another tale   and with that word he said  
as courteously as it had been a maid  
 my lady prioresse  by your leave  
so that i wist i shoulde you not grieve  
i woulde deeme that ye telle should 
a tale next  if so were that ye would  
now will ye vouchesafe  my lady dear   
 gladly   quoth she  and said as ye shall hear  
 
the tale  
 
o lord our lord  thy name how marvellous 
is in this large world y spread  quoth she 
for not only thy laude precious 
performed is by men of high degree  
but by the mouth of children thy bounte odness 
performed is  for on the breast sucking 
sometimes showe they thy herying  
wherefore in laud  as i best can or may 
of thee  and of the white lily flow r 
which that thee bare  and is a maid alway  
to tell a story i will do my labour  
not that i may increase her honour  
for she herselven is honour and root 
of bounte  next her son  and soules  boot  
o mother maid  o maid and mother free  
o bush unburnt  burning in moses  sight  
that ravished st down from the deity  
through thy humbless  the ghost that in thee light  
of whose virtue  when he thine hearte light  
conceived was the father s sapience  
help me to tell it to thy reverence  
lady  thy bounty  thy magnificence  
thy virtue  and thy great humility  
there may no tongue express in no science  
for sometimes  lady  ere men pray to thee  
thou go st before  of thy benignity  
and gettest us the light  through thy prayere  
to guiden us unto thy son so dear  
my conning is so weak  o blissful queen  
for to declare thy great worthiness  
that i not may the weight of it sustene  
but as a child of twelvemonth old  or less  
that can unnethes any word express  
right so fare i  and therefore  i you pray  
guide my song that i shall of you say  
there was in asia  in a great city  
amonges christian folk  a jewery  
sustained by a lord of that country  
for foul usure  and lucre of villainy  
hateful to christ  and to his company  
and through the street men mighte ride and wend  
for it was free  and open at each end  
a little school of christian folk there stood 
down at the farther end  in which there were 
children an heap y come of christian blood  
that learned in that schoole year by year 
such manner doctrine as men used there  
this is to say  to singen and to read  
as smalle children do in their childhead  
among these children was a widow s son  
a little clergion  seven year of age  
that day by day to scholay was his won  
and eke also  whereso he saw th  image 
of christe s mother  had he in usage  
as him was taught  to kneel adown  and say 
ave maria as he went by the way  
thus had this widow her little son y taught 
our blissful lady  christe s mother dear  
to worship aye  and he forgot it not  
for sely child will always soone lear  
but aye when i remember on this mattere  
saint nicholas stands ever in my presence  
for he so young to christ did reverence  
this little child his little book learning  
as he sat in the school at his primere  
he alma redemptoris hearde sing  
as children learned their antiphonere  
and as he durst  he drew him nere and nere  
and hearken d aye the wordes and the note  
till he the firste verse knew all by rote  
nought wist he what this latin was tosay  
for he so young and tender was of age  
but on a day his fellow gan he pray 
to expound him this song in his language  
or tell him why this song was in usage  
this pray d he him to construe and declare  
full oftentime upon his knees bare  
his fellow  which that elder was than he  
answer d him thus   this song  i have heard say  
was maked of our blissful lady free  
her to salute  and eke her to pray 
to be our help and succour when we dey  
i can no more expound in this mattere  
i learne song  i know but small grammere   
 and is this song y made in reverence 
of christe s mother   said this innocent  
now certes i will do my diligence 
to conne it all  ere christemas be went  
though that i for my primer shall be shent  
and shall be beaten thries in an hour  
i will it conne  our lady to honour   
his fellow taught him homeward privily 
from day to day  till he coud it by rote  
and then he sang it well and boldely 
from word to word according with the note  
twice in a day it passed through his throat  
to schoole ward  and homeward when he went  
on christ s mother was set all his intent  
as i have said  throughout the jewery  
this little child  as he came to and fro  
full merrily then would he sing and cry  
o alma redemptoris  evermo   
the sweetness hath his hearte pierced so 
of christe s mother  that to her to pray 
he cannot stint of singing by the way  
our firste foe  the serpent satanas  
that hath in jewes  heart his waspe s nest  
upswell d and said   o hebrew people  alas  
is this to you a thing that is honest  
that such a boy shall walken as him lest 
in your despite  and sing of such sentence  
which is against your lawe s reverence   
from thenceforth the jewes have conspired 
this innocent out of the world to chase  
a homicide thereto have they hired  
that in an alley had a privy place  
and  as the child gan forth by for to pace  
this cursed jew him hent  and held him fast 
and cut his throat  and in a pit him cast  
i say that in a wardrobe he him threw  
where as the jewes purged their entrail  
o cursed folk  o herodes all new  
what may your evil intente you avail  
murder will out  certain it will not fail  
and namely where th  honour of god shall spread  
the blood out crieth on your cursed deed  
o martyr souded to virginity  
now may st thou sing  and follow ever in one 
the white lamb celestial quoth she  
of which the great evangelist saint john 
in patmos wrote  which saith that they that gon 
before this lamb  and sing a song all new  
that never fleshly woman they ne knew  
this poore widow waited all that night 
after her little child  but he came not  
for which  as soon as it was daye s light  
with face pale  in dread and busy thought  
she hath at school and elleswhere him sought  
till finally she gan so far espy  
that he was last seen in the jewery  
with mother s pity in her breast enclosed  
she went  as she were half out of her mind  
to every place  where she hath supposed 
by likelihood her little child to find  
and ever on christ s mother meek and kind 
she cried  and at the laste thus she wrought  
among the cursed jewes she him sought  
she freined  and she prayed piteously 
to every jew that dwelled in that place  
to tell her  if her childe went thereby  
they saide   nay   but jesus of his grace 
gave in her thought  within a little space  
that in that place after her son she cried  
where he was cast into a pit beside  
o greate god  that preformest thy laud 
by mouth of innocents  lo here thy might  
this gem of chastity  this emeraud  
and eke of martyrdom the ruby bright  
where he with throat y carven lay upright  
he alma redemptoris gan to sing 
so loud  that all the place began to ring  
the christian folk  that through the streete went  
in came  for to wonder on this thing  
and hastily they for the provost sent  
he came anon withoute tarrying  
and heried christ  that is of heaven king  
and eke his mother  honour of mankind  
and after that the jewes let he bind  
with torment  and with shameful death each one 
the provost did these jewes for to sterve 
that of this murder wist  and that anon  
he woulde no such cursedness observe 
evil shall have that evil will deserve  
therefore with horses wild he did them draw  
and after that he hung them by the law  
the child  with piteous lamentation  
was taken up  singing his song alway  
and with honour and great procession  
they crry him unto the next abbay  
his mother swooning by the biere lay  
unnethes might the people that were there 
this newe rachel bringe from his bier  
upon his biere lay this innocent 
before the altar while the masses last   
and  after that  th  abbot with his convent 
have sped them for to bury him full fast  
and when they holy water on him cast  
yet spake this child  when sprinkled was the water  
and sang  o alma redemptoris mater  
this abbot  which that was a holy man  
as monkes be  or elles ought to be  
this younger child to conjure he began  
and said   o deare child  i halse thee  
in virtue of the holy trinity  
tell me what is thy cause for to sing  
since that thy throat is cut  to my seeming   
 my throat is cut unto my necke bone   
saide this child   and  as by way of kind  
i should have died  yea long time agone  
but jesus christ  as ye in bookes find  
will that his glory last and be in mind  
and  for the worship of his mother dear  
yet may i sing o alma loud and clear  
 this well of mercy  christe s mother sweet  
i loved alway  after my conning  
and when that i my life should forlete  
to me she came  and bade me for to sing 
this anthem verily in my dying  
as ye have heard  and  when that i had sung  
me thought she laid a grain upon my tongue  
 wherefore i sing  and sing i must certain  
in honour of that blissful maiden free  
till from my tongue off taken is the grain  
and after that thus saide she to me  
 my little child  then will i fetche thee  
when that the grain is from thy tongue take  
be not aghast  i will thee not forsake    
this holy monk  this abbot him mean i  
his tongue out caught  and took away the grain  
and he gave up the ghost full softely  
and when this abbot had this wonder seen  
his salte teares trickled down as rain  
and groff he fell all flat upon the ground  
and still he lay  as he had been y bound  
the convent lay eke on the pavement 
weeping  and herying christ s mother dear  
and after that they rose  and forth they went  
and took away this martyr from his bier  
and in a tomb of marble stones clear 
enclosed they his little body sweet  
where he is now  god lene us for to meet  
o younge hugh of lincoln  slain also 
with cursed jewes    as it is notable  
for it is but a little while ago    
pray eke for us  we sinful folk unstable  
that  of his mercy  god so merciable 
on us his greate mercy multiply  
for reverence of his mother mary

the tale 
 
the first fit 
 
listen  lordings  in good intent  
and i will tell you verrament 
of mirth and of solas  
all of a knight was fair and gent  
in battle and in tournament  
his name was sir thopas  
y born he was in far country  
in flanders  all beyond the sea  
at popering in the place  
his father was a man full free  
and lord he was of that country  
as it was godde s grace  
sir thopas was a doughty swain  
white was his face as paindemain  
his lippes red as rose  
his rode is like scarlet in grain  
and i you tell in good certain 
he had a seemly nose  
his hair  his beard  was like saffroun  
that to his girdle reach d adown  
his shoes of cordewane  
of bruges were his hosen brown  
his robe was of ciclatoun  
that coste many a jane  
he coulde hunt at the wild deer  
and ride on hawking for rivere 
with gray goshawk on hand  
thereto he was a good archere  
of wrestling was there none his peer  
where any ram should stand  
full many a maiden bright in bow r 
they mourned for him par amour  
when them were better sleep  
but he was chaste  and no lechour  
and sweet as is the bramble flow r 
that beareth the red heep  
and so it fell upon a day  
for sooth as i you telle may  
sir thopas would out ride  
he worth upon his steede gray  
and in his hand a launcegay  
a long sword by his side  
he pricked through a fair forest  
wherein is many a wilde beast  
yea  bothe buck and hare  
and as he pricked north and east  
i tell it you  him had almest 
betid a sorry care  
there sprange herbes great and small  
the liquorice and the setewall  
and many a clove gilofre  
and nutemeg to put in ale  
whether it be moist or stale  
or for to lay in coffer  
the birdes sang  it is no nay  
the sperhawk and the popinjay  
that joy it was to hear  
the throstle cock made eke his lay  
the woode dove upon the spray 
she sang full loud and clear  
sir thopas fell in love longing 
all when he heard the throstle sing  
and prick d as he were wood  
his faire steed in his pricking 
so sweated  that men might him wring  
his sides were all blood  
sir thopas eke so weary was 
for pricking on the softe grass  
so fierce was his corage  
that down he laid him in that place  
to make his steed some solace  
and gave him good forage  
 ah  saint mary  ben dicite  
what aileth thilke love at me 
to binde me so sore  
me dreamed all this night  pardie  
an elf queen shall my leman be  
and sleep under my gore  
an elf queen will i love  y wis  
for in this world no woman is 
worthy to be my make 
in town  
all other women i forsake  
and to an elf queen i me take 
by dale and eke by down   
into his saddle he clomb anon  
and pricked over stile and stone 
an elf queen for to spy  
till he so long had ridden and gone  
that he found in a privy wonne 
the country of faery  
so wild  
for in that country was there none 
that to him durste ride or gon  
neither wife nor child  
till that there came a great giaunt  
his name was sir oliphaunt  
a perilous man of deed  
he saide   child  by termagaunt  
but if thou prick out of mine haunt  
anon i slay thy steed 
with mace  
here is the queen of faery  
with harp  and pipe  and symphony  
dwelling in this place   
the child said   all so may i the  
to morrow will i meete thee  
when i have mine armor  
and yet i hope  par ma fay  
that thou shalt with this launcegay 
abyen it full sore  
thy maw 
shall i pierce  if i may  
ere it be fully prime of day  
for here thou shalt be slaw   
sir thopas drew aback full fast  
this giant at him stones cast 
out of a fell staff sling  
but fair escaped child thopas  
and all it was through godde s grace  
and through his fair bearing  
yet listen  lordings  to my tale  
merrier than the nightingale  
for now i will you rown  
how sir thopas  with sides smale  
pricking over hill and dale  
is come again to town  
his merry men commanded he 
to make him both game and glee  
for needes must he fight 
with a giant with heades three  
for paramour and jollity 
of one that shone full bright  
 do come   he saide   my minstrales 
and gestours for to telle tales  
anon in mine arming  
of romances that be royales  
of popes and of cardinales  
and eke of love longing

and mead eke in a maseline  
and royal spicery  of maple wood 
of ginger bread that was full fine  
and liquorice and eke cumin  
with sugar that is trie  
he didde  next his white lere  
of cloth of lake fine and clear  
a breech and eke a shirt  
and next his shirt an haketon  
and over that an habergeon  
for piercing of his heart  
and over that a fine hauberk  
was all y wrought of jewes  
full strong it was of plate  
and over that his coat armour  
as white as is the lily flow r  
in which he would debate  
his shield was all of gold so red 
and therein was a boare s head  
a charboucle beside  
and there he swore on ale and bread  
how that the giant should be dead  
betide whatso betide  
his jambeaux were of cuirbouly  
his sworde s sheath of ivory  
his helm of latoun bright  
his saddle was of rewel bone  
his bridle as the sunne shone  
or as the moonelight  
his speare was of fine cypress  
that bodeth war  and nothing peace  
the head full sharp y ground  
his steede was all dapple gray  
it went an amble in the way 
full softely and round 
in land  
lo  lordes mine  here is a fytt  
if ye will any more of it  
to tell it will i fand

of battle and of chivalry  
of ladies  love and druerie  
anon i will you tell  
men speak of romances of price 
of horn child  and of ipotis  
of bevis  and sir guy  
of sir libeux  and pleindamour  
but sir thopas  he bears the flow r 
of royal chivalry  
his goode steed he all bestrode  
and forth upon his way he glode  
as sparkle out of brand  
upon his crest he bare a tow r  
and therein stick d a lily flow r  
god shield his corse from shand  
and  for he was a knight auntrous  
he woulde sleepen in none house  
but liggen in his hood  
his brighte helm was his wanger  
and by him baited his destrer 
of herbes fine and good  
himself drank water of the well

chaucer s tale of meliboeus  
 
the prologue  
 
 no more of this  for godde s dignity   
quoth oure hoste   for thou makest me 
so weary of thy very lewedness  
that  all so wisly god my soule bless  
mine eares ache for thy drafty speech  
now such a rhyme the devil i beteche  
this may well be rhyme doggerel   quoth he  
 why so   quoth i   why wilt thou lette me 
more of my tale than any other man  
since that it is the best rhyme that i can   
 by god   quoth he   for  plainly at one word  
thy drafty rhyming is not worth a tord  
thou dost naught elles but dispendest time  
sir  at one word  thou shalt no longer rhyme  
let see whether thou canst tellen aught 
or tell in prose somewhat  at the least  narrative 
in which there be some mirth or some doctrine   
 gladly   quoth i   by godde s sweete pine  
i will you tell a little thing in prose  
that oughte like you  as i suppose  
or else certes ye be too dangerous  
it is a moral tale virtuous  
all be it told sometimes in sundry wise 
by sundry folk  as i shall you devise  
as thus  ye wot that ev ry evangelist  
that telleth us the pain of jesus christ  
he saith not all thing as his fellow doth  
but natheless their sentence is all soth  
and all accorden as in their sentence  
all be there in their telling difference  
for some of them say more  and some say less  
when they his piteous passion express  
i mean of mark and matthew  luke and john  
but doubteless their sentence is all one  
therefore  lordinges all  i you beseech  
if that ye think i vary in my speech  
as thus  though that i telle somedeal more 
of proverbes  than ye have heard before 
comprehended in this little treatise here  
t enforce with the effect of my mattere  
and though i not the same wordes say enforce 
as ye have heard  yet to you all i pray 
blame me not  for as in my sentence 
shall ye nowhere finde no difference 
from the sentence of thilke treatise lite  
after the which this merry tale i write  
and therefore hearken to what i shall say  
and let me tellen all my tale  i pray   
 
the tale  
 
a young man called meliboeus  mighty and rich  begat upon his wife  that called was prudence  a daughter which that called was sophia  upon a day befell  that he for his disport went into the fields him to play  his wife and eke his daughter hath he left within his house  of which the doors were fast shut  three of his old foes have it espied  and set ladders to the walls of his house  and by the windows be entered  and beaten his wife  and wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds  in five sundry places  that is to say  in her feet  in her hands  in her ears  in her nose  and in her mouth  and left her for dead  and went away  when meliboeus returned was into his house  and saw all this mischief  he  like a man mad  rending his clothes  gan weep and cry  prudence his wife  as farforth as she durst  besought him of his weeping for to stint  but not forthy  notwithstanding  he gan to weep and cry ever longer the more  
 
this noble wife prudence remembered her upon the sentence of ovid  in his book that called is the  remedy of love   where he saith  he is a fool that disturbeth the mother to weep in the death of her child  till she have wept her fill  as for a certain time  and then shall a man do his diligence with amiable words her to recomfort and pray her of her weeping for to stint  cease   for which reason this noble wife prudence suffered her husband for to weep and cry  as for a certain space  and when she saw her time  she said to him in this wise   alas  my lord   quoth she   why make ye yourself for to be like a fool  for sooth it appertaineth not to a wise man to make such a sorrow  your daughter  with the grace of god  shall warish  be cured  and escape  and all  although  were it so that she right now were dead  ye ought not for her death yourself to destroy  seneca saith   the wise man shall not take too great discomfort for the death of his children  but certes he should suffer it in patience  as well as he abideth the death of his own proper person    
 
meliboeus answered anon and said   what man   quoth he   should of his weeping stint  that hath so great a cause to weep  jesus christ  our lord  himself wept for the death of lazarus his friend   prudence answered   certes  well i wot  attempered  moderate  weeping is nothing defended  forbidden  to him that sorrowful is  among folk in sorrow but it is rather granted him to weep  the apostle paul unto the romans writeth   man shall rejoice with them that make joy  and weep with such folk as weep   but though temperate weeping be granted  outrageous weeping certes is defended  measure of weeping should be conserved  after the lore  doctrine  that teacheth us seneca   when that thy friend is dead   quoth he   let not thine eyes too moist be of tears  nor too much dry  although the tears come to thine eyes  let them not fall  and when thou hast forgone  lost  thy friend  do diligence to get again another friend  and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend which that thou hast lorn  lost  for therein is no boot  advantage   and therefore if ye govern you by sapience  put away sorrow out of your heart  remember you that jesus sirach saith   a man that is joyous and glad in heart  it him conserveth flourishing in his age  but soothly a sorrowful heart maketh his bones dry   he said eke thus   that sorrow in heart slayth full many a man   solomon saith  that right as moths in the sheep s fleece annoy  do injury  to the clothes  and the small worms to the tree  right so annoyeth sorrow to the heart of man   wherefore us ought as well in the death of our children  as in the loss of our goods temporal  have patience  remember you upon the patient job  when he had lost his children and his temporal substance  and in his body endured and received full many a grievous tribulation  yet said he thus   our lord hath given it to me  our lord hath bereft it me  right as our lord would  right so be it done  blessed be the name of our lord    
 
to these foresaid things answered meliboeus unto his wife prudence   all thy words   quoth he   be true  and thereto  also  profitable  but truly mine heart is troubled with this sorrow so grievously  that i know not what to do    let call   quoth prudence   thy true friends all  and thy lineage  which be wise  and tell to them your case  and hearken what they say in counselling  and govern you after their sentence  opinion   solomon saith   work all things by counsel  and thou shall never repent    then  by counsel of his wife prudence  this meliboeus let call  sent for  a great congregation of folk  as surgeons  physicians  old folk and young  and some of his old enemies reconciled as by their semblance to his love and to his grace  and therewithal there come some of his neighbours  that did him reverence more for dread than for love  as happeneth oft  there come also full many subtle flatterers  and wise advocates learned in the law  and when these folk together assembled were  this meliboeus in sorrowful wise showed them his case  and by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bare a cruel ire  ready to do vengeance upon his foes  and suddenly desired that the war should begin  but nevertheless yet asked he their counsel in this matter  a surgeon  by licence and assent of such as were wise  up rose  and to meliboeus said as ye may hear   sir   quoth he   as to us surgeons appertaineth  that we do to every wight the best that we can  where as we be withholden   employed  and to our patient that we do no damage  wherefore it happeneth many a time and oft  that when two men have wounded each other  one same surgeon healeth them both  wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to nurse war  nor parties to support  take sides   but certes  as to the warishing  healing  of your daughter  albeit so that perilously she be wounded  we shall do so attentive business from day to night  that  with the grace of god  she shall be whole and sound  as soon as is possible   almost right in the same wise the physicians answered  save that they said a few words more  that right as maladies be cured by their contraries  right so shall man warish war by peace  his neighbours full of envy  his feigned friends that seemed reconciled  and his flatterers  made semblance of weeping  and impaired and agregged  aggravated  much of this matter  in praising greatly meliboeus of might  of power  of riches  and of friends  despising the power of his adversaries  and said utterly  that he anon should wreak him on his foes  and begin war  
 
up rose then an advocate that was wise  by leave and by counsel of other that were wise  and said   lordings  the need  business  for which we be assembled in this place  is a full heavy thing  and an high matter  because of the wrong and of the wickedness that hath been done  and eke by reason of the great damages that in time coming be possible to fall for the same cause  and eke by reason of the great riches and power of the parties both  for which reasons  it were a full great peril to err in this matter  wherefore  meliboeus  this is our sentence  opinion   we counsel you  above all things  that right anon thou do thy diligence in keeping of thy body  in such a wise that thou want no espy nor watch thy body to save  and after that  we counsel that in thine house thou set sufficient garrison  so that they may as well thy body as thy house defend  but  certes  to move war or suddenly to do vengeance  we may not deem  judge  in so little time that it were profitable  wherefore we ask leisure and space to have deliberation in this case to deem  for the common proverb saith thus   he that soon deemeth soon shall repent   and eke men say  that that judge is wise  that soon understandeth a matter  and judgeth by leisure  for albeit so that all tarrying be annoying  algates  nevertheless  it is no reproof  subject for reproach  in giving of judgement  nor in vengeance taking  when it is sufficient and  reasonable  and that shewed our lord jesus christ by example  for when that the woman that was taken in adultery was brought in his presence to know what should be done with her person  albeit that he wist well himself what he would answer  yet would he not answer suddenly  but he would have deliberation  and in the ground he wrote twice  and by these causes we ask deliberation and we shall then by the grace of god counsel the thing that shall be profitable   
 
up started then the young folk anon at once  and the most part of that company have scorned these old wise men and begun to make noise and said   right as while that iron is hot men should smite  right so men should wreak their wrongs while that they be fresh and new   and with loud voice they cried   war  war   up rose then one of these old wise  and with his hand made countenance  a sign  gesture  that men should hold them still  and give him audience   lordings   quoth he   there is full many a man that crieth   war  war   that wot full little what war amounteth  war at his beginning hath so great an entering and so large  that every wight may enter when him liketh  and lightly  easily  find war  but certes what end shall fall thereof it is not light to know  for soothly when war is once begun  there is full many a child unborn of his mother  that shall sterve  die  young by cause of that war  or else live in sorrow and die in wretchedness  and therefore  ere that any war be begun  men must have great counsel and great deliberation   and when this old man weened  thought  intended  to enforce his tale by reasons  well nigh all at once began they to rise for to break his tale  and bid him full oft his words abridge  for soothly he that preacheth to them that list not hear his words  his sermon them annoyeth  for jesus sirach saith  that music in weeping is a noyous  troublesome  thing  this is to say  as much availeth to speak before folk to whom his speech annoyeth  as to sing before him that weepeth  and when this wise man saw that him wanted audience  all shamefast he sat him down again  for solomon saith   where as thou mayest have no audience  enforce thee not to speak    i see well   quoth this wise man   that the common proverb is sooth  that good counsel wanteth  when it is most need   yet  besides  further  had this meliboeus in his council many folk  that privily in his ear counselled him certain thing  and counselled him the contrary in general audience  when meliboeus had heard that the greatest part of his council were accorded  in agreement  that he should make war  anon he consented to their counselling  and fully affirmed their sentence  opinion  judgement   
 
dame prudence  seeing her husband s resolution thus taken  in full humble wise  when she saw her time  begins to counsel him against war  by a warning against haste in requital of either good or evil  meliboeus tells her that he will not work by her counsel  because he should be held a fool if he rejected for her advice the opinion of so many wise men  because all women are bad  because it would seem that he had given her the mastery over him  and because she could not keep his secret  if he resolved to follow her advice  to these reasons prudence answers that it is no folly to change counsel when things  or men s judgements of them  change   especially to alter a resolution taken on the impulse of a great multitude of folk  where every man crieth and clattereth what him liketh  that if all women had been wicked  jesus christ would never have descended to be born of a woman  nor have showed himself first to a woman after his resurrection and that when solomon said he had found no good woman  he meant that god alone was supremely good  that her husband would not seem to give her the mastery by following her counsel  for he had his own free choice in following or rejecting it  and that he knew well and had often tested her great silence  patience  and secrecy  and whereas he had quoted a saying  that in wicked counsel women vanquish men  she reminds him that she would counsel him against doing a wickedness on which he had set his mind  and cites instances to show that many women have been and yet are full good  and their counsel wholesome and profitable  lastly  she quotes the words of god himself  when he was about to make woman as an help meet for man  and promises that  if her husband will trust her counsel  she will restore to him his daughter whole and sound  and make him have honour in this case  meliboeus answers that because of his wife s sweet words  and also because he has proved and assayed her great wisdom and her great truth  he will govern him by her counsel in all things  thus encouraged  prudence enters on a long discourse  full of learned citations  regarding the manner in which counsellors should be chosen and consulted  and the times and reasons for changing a counsel  first  god must be besought for guidance  then a man must well examine his own thoughts  of such things as he holds to be best for his own profit  driving out of his heart anger  covetousness  and hastiness  which perturb and pervert the judgement  then he must keep his counsel secret  unless confiding it to another shall be more profitable  but  in so confiding it  he shall say nothing to bias the mind of the counsellor toward flattery or subserviency  after that he should consider his friends and his enemies  choosing of the former such as be most faithful and wise  and eldest and most approved in counselling  and even of these only a few  then he must eschew the counselling of fools  of flatterers  of his old enemies that be reconciled  of servants who bear him great reverence and fear  of folk that be drunken and can hide no counsel  of such as counsel one thing privily and the contrary openly  and of young folk  for their counselling is not ripe  then  in examining his counsel  he must truly tell his tale  he must consider whether the thing he proposes to do be reasonable  within his power  and acceptable to the more part and the better part of his counsellors  he must look at the things that may follow from that counselling  choosing the best and waiving all besides  he must consider the root whence the matter of his counsel is engendered  what fruits it may bear  and from what causes they be sprung  and having thus examined his counsel and approved it by many wise folk and old  he shall consider if he may perform it and make of it a good end  if he be in doubt  he shall choose rather to suffer than to begin  but otherwise he shall prosecute his resolution steadfastly till the enterprise be at an end  as to changing his counsel  a man may do so without reproach  if the cause cease  or when a new case betides  or if he find that by error or otherwise harm or damage may result  or if his counsel be dishonest or come of dishonest cause  or if it be impossible or may not properly be kept  and he must take it for a general rule  that every counsel which is affirmed so strongly  that it may not be changed for any condition that may betide  that counsel is wicked  meliboeus  admitting that his wife had spoken well and suitably as to counsellors and counsel in general  prays her to tell him in especial what she thinks of the counsellors whom they have chosen in their present need  prudence replies that his counsel in this case could not properly be called a counselling  but a movement of folly  and points out that he has erred in sundry wise against the rules which he had just laid down  granting that he has erred  meliboeus says that he is all ready to change his counsel right as she will devise  for  as the proverb runs  to do sin is human  but to persevere long in sin is work of the devil  prudence then minutely recites  analyses  and criticises the counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends  she commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons  and urges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech and their services in healing sophia  and she asks meliboeus how he understands their proposition that one contrary must be cured by another contrary  meliboeus answers  that he should do vengeance on his enemies  who had done him wrong  prudence  however  insists that vengeance is not the contrary of vengeance  nor wrong of wrong  but the like  and that wickedness should be healed by goodness  discord by accord  war by peace  she proceeds to deal with the counsel of the lawyers and wise folk that advised meliboeus to take prudent measures for the security of his body and of his house  first  she would have her husband pray for the protection and aid of christ  then commit the keeping of his person to his true friends  then suspect and avoid all strange folk  and liars  and such people as she had already warned him against  then beware of presuming on his strength  or the weakness of his adversary  and neglecting to guard his person   for every wise man dreadeth his enemy  then he should evermore be on the watch against ambush and all espial  even in what seems a place of safety  though he should not be so cowardly  as to fear where is no cause for dread  yet he should dread to be poisoned  and therefore shun scorners  and fly their words as venom  as to the fortification of his house  she points out that towers and great edifices are costly and laborious  yet useless unless defended by true friends that be old and wise  and the greatest and strongest garrison that a rich man may have  as well to keep his person as his goods  is  that he be beloved by his subjects and by his neighbours  warmly approving the counsel that in all this business meliboeus should proceed with great diligence and deliberation  prudence goes on to examine the advice given by his neighbours that do him reverence without love  his old enemies reconciled  his flatterers that counselled him certain things privily and openly counselled him the contrary  and the young folk that counselled him to avenge himself and make war at once  she reminds him that he stands alone against three powerful enemies  whose kindred are numerous and close  while his are fewer and remote in relationship  that only the judge who has jurisdiction in a case may take sudden vengeance on any man  that her husband s power does not accord with his desire  and that  if he did take vengeance  it would only breed fresh wrongs and contests  as to the causes of the wrong done to him  she holds that god  the causer of all things  has permitted him to suffer because he has drunk so much honey of sweet temporal riches  and delights  and honours of this world  that he is drunken  and has forgotten jesus christ his saviour  the three enemies of mankind  the flesh  the fiend  and the world  have entered his heart by the windows of his body  and wounded his soul in five places   that is to say  the deadly sins that have entered into his heart by the five senses  and in the same manner christ has suffered his three enemies to enter his house by the windows  and wound his daughter in the five places before specified  meliboeus demurs  that if his wife s objections prevailed  vengeance would never be taken  and thence great mischiefs would arise  but prudence replies that the taking of vengeance lies with the judges  to whom the private individual must have recourse  meliboeus declares that such vengeance does not please him  and that  as fortune has nourished and helped him from his childhood  he will now assay her  trusting  with god s help  that she will aid him to avenge his shame  prudence warns him against trusting to fortune  all the less because she has hitherto favoured him  for just on that account she is the more likely to fail him  and she calls on him to leave his vengeance with the sovereign judge  that avengeth all villainies and wrongs  meliboeus argues that if he refrains from taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him further wrong  and he will be put and held over low  but prudence contends that such a result can be brought about only by the neglect of the judges  not by the patience of the individual  supposing that he had leave to avenge himself  she repeats that he is not strong enough  and quotes the common saw  that it is madness for a man to strive with a stronger than himself  peril to strive with one of equal strength  and folly to strive with a weaker  but  considering his own defaults and demerits    remembering the patience of christ and the undeserved tribulations of the saints  the brevity of this life with all its trouble and sorrow  the discredit thrown on the wisdom and training of a man who cannot bear wrong with patience   he should refrain wholly from taking vengeance  meliboeus submits that he is not at all a perfect man  and his heart will never be at peace until he is avenged  and that as his enemies disregarded the peril when they attacked him  so he might  without reproach  incur some peril in attacking them in return  even though he did a great excess in avenging one wrong by another  prudence strongly deprecates all outrage or excess  but meliboeus insists that he cannot see that it might greatly harm him though he took a vengeance  for he is richer and mightier than his enemies  and all things obey money  prudence thereupon launches into a long dissertation on the advantages of riches  the evils of poverty  the means by which wealth should be gathered  and the manner in which it should be used  and concludes by counselling her husband not to move war and battle through trust in his riches  for they suffice not to maintain war  the battle is not always to the strong or the numerous  and the perils of conflict are many  meliboeus then curtly asks her for her counsel how he shall do in this need  and she answers that certainly she counsels him to agree with his adversaries and have peace with them  meliboeus on this cries out that plainly she loves not his honour or his worship  in counselling him to go and humble himself before his enemies  crying mercy to them that  having done him so grievous wrong  ask him not to be reconciled  then prudence  making semblance of wrath  retorts that she loves his honour and profit as she loves her own  and ever has done  she cites the scriptures in support of her counsel to seek peace  and says she will leave him to his own courses  for she knows well he is so stubborn  that he will do nothing for her  meliboeus then relents  admits that he is angry and cannot judge aright  and puts himself wholly in her hands  promising to do just as she desires  and admitting that he is the more held to love and praise her  if she reproves him of his folly 
 
then dame prudence discovered all her counsel and her will unto him  and said   i counsel you   quoth she   above all things  that ye make peace between god and you  and be reconciled unto him and to his grace  for  as i have said to you herebefore  god hath suffered you to have this tribulation and disease  distress  trouble  for your sins  and if ye do as i say you  god will send your adversaries unto you  and make them fall at your feet  ready to do your will and your commandment  for solomon saith   when the condition of man is pleasant and liking to god  he changeth the hearts of the man s adversaries  and constraineth them to beseech him of peace of grace   and i pray you let me speak with your adversaries in privy place  for they shall not know it is by your will or your assent  and then  when i know their will and their intent  i may counsel you the more surely     dame   quoth meliboeus    do your will and your liking  for i put me wholly in your disposition and ordinance   
 
then dame prudence  when she saw the goodwill of her husband  deliberated and took advice in herself  thinking how she might bring this need  affair  emergency  unto a good end  and when she saw her time  she sent for these adversaries to come into her into a privy place  and showed wisely into them the great goods that come of peace  and the great harms and perils that be in war  and said to them  in goodly manner  how that they ought have great repentance of the injuries and wrongs that they had done to meliboeus her lord  and unto her and her daughter  and when they heard the goodly words of dame prudence  then they were surprised and ravished  and had so great joy of her  that wonder was to tell   ah lady   quoth they   ye have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness  after the saying of david the prophet  for the reconciling which we be not worthy to have in no manner  but we ought require it with great contrition and humility  ye of your great goodness have presented unto us  now see we well  that the science and conning  knowledge  of solomon is full true  for he saith  that sweet words multiply and increase friends  and make shrews  the ill natured or angry  to be debonair  gentle  courteous  and meek  certes we put our deed  and all our matter and cause  all wholly in your goodwill  and be ready to obey unto the speech and commandment of my lord meliboeus  and therefore  dear and benign lady  we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we can and may  that it like unto your great goodness to fulfil in deed your goodly words  for we consider and acknowledge that we have offended and grieved my lord meliboeus out of measure  so far forth that we be not of power to make him amends  and therefore we oblige and bind us and our friends to do all his will and his commandment  but peradventure he hath such heaviness and such wrath to usward   towards us  because of our offence  that he will enjoin us such a pain  penalty  as we may not bear nor sustain  and therefore  noble lady  we beseech to your womanly pity to take such advisement  consideration  in this need  that we  nor our friends  be not disinherited and destroyed through our folly   
 
 certes   quoth prudence   it is an hard thing  and right perilous  that a man put him all utterly in the arbitration and judgement and in the might and power of his enemy  for solomon saith   believe me  and give credence to that that i shall say  to thy son  to thy wife  to thy friend  nor to thy brother  give thou never might nor mastery over thy body  while thou livest   now  since he defendeth  forbiddeth  that a man should not give to his brother  nor to his friend  the might of his body  by a stronger reason he defendeth and forbiddeth a man to give himself to his enemy  and nevertheless  i counsel you that ye mistrust not my lord  for i wot well and know verily  that he is debonair and meek  large  courteous and nothing desirous nor envious of good nor riches  for there is nothing in this world that he desireth save only worship and honour  furthermore i know well  and am right sure  that he shall nothing do in this need without counsel of me  and i shall so work in this case  that by the grace of our lord god ye shall be reconciled unto us   
 
then said they with one voice    worshipful lady  we put us and our goods all fully in your will and disposition  and be ready to come  what day that it like unto your nobleness to limit us or assign us  for to make our obligation and bond  as strong as it liketh unto your goodness  that we may fulfil the will of you and of my lord meliboeus   
 
when dame prudence had heard the answer of these men  she bade them go again privily  and she returned to her lord meliboeus  and told him how she found his adversaries full repentant  acknowledging full lowly their sins and trespasses  and how they were ready to suffer all pain  requiring and praying him of mercy and pity  then said meliboeus   he is well worthy to have pardon and forgiveness of his sin  that excuseth not his sin  but acknowledgeth  and repenteth him  asking indulgence  for seneca saith   there is the remission and forgiveness  where the confession is  for confession is neighbour to innocence   and therefore i assent and confirm me to have peace  but it is good that we do naught without the assent and will of our friends   then was prudence right glad and joyful  and said   certes  sir  ye be well and goodly advised  for right as by the counsel  assent  and help of your friends ye have been stirred to avenge you and make war  right so without their counsel shall ye not accord you  nor have peace with your adversaries  for the law saith   there is nothing so good by way of kind   nature  as a thing to be unbound by him that it was bound    
 
and then dame prudence  without delay or tarrying  sent anon her messengers for their kin and for their old friends  which were true and wise  and told them by order  in the presence of meliboeus  all this matter  as it is above expressed and declared  and prayed them that they would give their advice and counsel what were best to do in this need  and when meliboeus  friends had taken their advice and deliberation of the foresaid matter  and had examined it by great business and great diligence  they gave full counsel for to have peace and rest  and that meliboeus should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness and mercy  and when dame prudence had heard the assent of her lord meliboeus  and the counsel of his friends  accord with her will and her intention  she was wondrous glad in her heart  and said   there is an old proverb that saith   the goodness that thou mayest do this day  do it  and abide not nor delay it not till to morrow   and therefore i counsel you that ye send your messengers  such as be discreet and wise  unto your adversaries  telling them on your behalf  that if they will treat of peace and of accord  that they shape  prepare  them  without delay or tarrying  to come unto us   which thing performed was indeed  and when these trespassers and repenting folk of their follies  that is to say  the adversaries of meliboeus  had heard what these messengers said unto them  they were right glad and joyful  and answered full meekly and benignly  yielding graces and thanks to their lord meliboeus  and to all his company  and shaped them without delay to go with the messengers  and obey to the commandment of their lord meliboeus  and right anon they took their way to the court of meliboeus  and took with them some of their true friends  to make faith for them  and for to be their borrows  sureties   
 
and when they were come to the presence of meliboeus  he said to them these words   it stands thus   quoth meliboeus   and sooth it is  that ye causeless  and without skill and reason  have done great injuries and wrongs to me  and to my wife prudence  and to my daughter also  for ye have entered into my house by violence  and have done such outrage  that all men know well that ye have deserved the death  and therefore will i know and weet of you  whether ye will put the punishing and chastising  and the vengeance of this outrage  in the will of me and of my wife  or ye will not   then the wisest of them three answered for them all  and said   sir   quoth he   we know well  that we be i unworthy to come to the court of so great a lord and so worthy as ye be  for we have so greatly mistaken us  and have offended and aguilt  incurred guilt  in such wise against your high lordship  that truly we have deserved the death  but yet for the great goodness and debonairte  courtesy  gentleness  that all the world witnesseth of your person  we submit us to the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship  and be ready to obey to all your commandments  beseeching you  that of your merciable  merciful  pity ye will consider our great repentance and low submission  and grant us forgiveness of our outrageous trespass and offence  for well we know  that your liberal grace and mercy stretch them farther into goodness  than do our outrageous guilt and trespass into wickedness  albeit that cursedly  wickedly  and damnably we have aguilt  incurred guilt  against your high lordship   then meliboeus took them up from the ground full benignly  and received their obligations and their bonds  by their oaths upon their pledges and borrows   sureties  and assigned them a certain day to return unto his court for to receive and accept sentence and judgement  that meliboeus would command to be done on them  by the causes aforesaid  which things ordained  every man returned home to his house  
 
and when that dame prudence saw her time she freined  inquired  and asked her lord meliboeus  what vengeance he thought to take of his adversaries  to which meliboeus answered  and said   certes   quoth he   i think and purpose me fully to disinherit them of all that ever they have  and for to put them in exile for evermore    certes   quoth dame prudence   this were a cruel sentence  and much against reason  for ye be rich enough  and have no need of other men s goods  and ye might lightly  easily  in this wise get you a covetous name  which is a vicious thing  and ought to be eschewed of every good man  for  after the saying of the apostle  covetousness is root of all harms  and therefore it were better for you to lose much good of your own  than for to take of their good in this manner  for better it is to lose good with worship  honour   than to win good with villainy and shame  and every man ought to do his diligence and his business to get him a good name  and yet  further  shall he not only busy him in keeping his good name  but he shall also enforce him alway to do some thing by which he may renew his good name  for it is written  that the old good los  reputation   of a man is soon gone and passed  when it is not renewed  and as touching that ye say  that ye will exile your adversaries  that thinketh ye much against reason  and out of measure   moderation  considered the power that they have given you upon themselves  and it is written  that he is worthy to lose his privilege  that misuseth the might and the power that is given him  and i set case  if i assume  ye might enjoin them that pain by right and by law which i trow ye may not do  i say  ye might not put it to execution peradventure  and then it were like to return to the war  as it was before  and therefore if ye will that men do you obeisance  ye must deem  decide  more courteously  that is to say  ye must give more easy sentences and judgements  for it is written   he that most courteously commandeth  to him men most obey   and therefore i pray you  that in this necessity and in this need ye cast you  endeavour  devise a way  to overcome your heart  for seneca saith  that he that overcometh his heart  overcometh twice  and tullius saith   there is nothing so commendable in a great lord  as when he is debonair and meek  and appeaseth him lightly  easily    and i pray you  that ye will now forbear to do vengeance  in such a manner  that your good name may be kept and conserved  and that men may have cause and matter to praise you of pity and of mercy  and that ye have no cause to repent you of thing that ye do  for seneca saith   he overcometh in an evil manner  that repenteth him of his victory   wherefore i pray you let mercy be in your heart  to the effect and intent that god almighty have mercy upon you in his last judgement  for saint james saith in his epistle   judgement without mercy shall be done to him  that hath no mercy of another wight    
 
when meliboeus had heard the great skills  arguments  reasons  and reasons of dame prudence  and her wise information and teaching  his heart gan incline to the will of his wife  considering her true intent  he conformed him anon and assented fully to work after her counsel  and thanked god  of whom proceedeth all goodness and all virtue  that him sent a wife of so great discretion  and when the day came that his adversaries should appear in his presence  he spake to them full goodly  and said in this wise   albeit so  that of your pride and high presumption and folly  an of your negligence and unconning   ignorance  ye have misborne  misbehaved  you  and trespassed  done injury  unto me  yet forasmuch as i see and behold your great humility  and that ye be sorry and repentant of your guilts  it constraineth me to do you grace and mercy  wherefore i receive you into my grace  and forgive you utterly all the offences  injuries  and wrongs  that ye have done against me and mine  to this effect and to this end  that god of his endless mercy will at the time of our dying forgive us our guilts  that we have trespassed to him in this wretched world  for doubtless  if we be sorry and repentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed in the sight of our lord god  he is so free and so merciable  merciful   that he will forgive us our guilts  and bring us to the bliss that never hath end   amen  
 
the monk s tale  
 
the prologue 
 
when ended was my tale of melibee  
and of prudence and her benignity  
our hoste said   as i am faithful man  
and by the precious corpus madrian  
i had lever than a barrel of ale  
that goode lefe my wife had heard this tale  
for she is no thing of such patience 
as was this meliboeus  wife prudence  
by godde s bones  when i beat my knaves 
she bringeth me the greate clubbed staves  
and crieth   slay the dogges every one  
and break of them both back and ev ry bone   
and if that any neighebour of mine 
will not in church unto my wife incline  
or be so hardy to her to trespace  
when she comes home she rampeth in my face  
and crieth   false coward  wreak thy wife 
by corpus domini  i will have thy knife  
and thou shalt have my distaff  and go spin   
from day till night right thus she will begin  
  alas   she saith   that ever i was shape 
to wed a milksop  or a coward ape  
that will be overlad with every wight  
thou darest not stand by thy wife s right   
 this is my life  but if that i will fight  
and out at door anon i must me dight  
or elles i am lost  but if that i 
be  like a wilde lion  fool hardy  
i wot well she will do me slay some day 
some neighebour and thenne my way  
for i am perilous with knife in hand  
albeit that i dare not her withstand  
for she is big in armes  by my faith  
that shall he find  that her misdoth or saith  
but let us pass away from this mattere  
my lord the monk   quoth he   be merry of cheer  
for ye shall tell a tale truely  
lo  rochester stands here faste by  
ride forth  mine owen lord  break not our game  
but by my troth i cannot tell your name  
whether shall i call you my lord dan john  
or dan thomas  or elles dan albon  
of what house be ye  by your father s kin  
i vow to god  thou hast a full fair skin  
it is a gentle pasture where thou go st  
thou art not like a penant or a ghost  
upon my faith thou art some officer  
some worthy sexton  or some cellarer  
for by my father s soul  as to my dome  
thou art a master when thou art at home  
no poore cloisterer  nor no novice  
but a governor  both wily and wise  
and therewithal  of brawnes and of bones  
a right well faring person for the nonce  
i pray to god give him confusion 
that first thee brought into religion  
thou would st have been a treade fowl aright  
hadst thou as greate leave  as thou hast might  
to perform all thy lust in engendrure  
thou hadst begotten many a creature  
alas  why wearest thou so wide a cope  
god give me sorrow  but  an i were pope  
not only thou  but every mighty man  
though he were shorn full high upon his pan  
should have a wife  for all this world is lorn  
religion hath ta en up all the corn 
of treading  and we borel men be shrimps  
of feeble trees there come wretched imps  
this maketh that our heires be so slender 
and feeble  that they may not well engender  
this maketh that our wives will assay 
religious folk  for they may better pay 
of venus  payementes than may we  
god wot  no lusheburghes paye ye  
but be not wroth  my lord  though that i play  
full oft in game a sooth have i heard say   
this worthy monk took all in patience  
and said   i will do all my diligence  
as far as souneth unto honesty  
to telle you a tale  or two or three  
and if you list to hearken hitherward  
i will you say the life of saint edward  
or elles first tragedies i will tell  
of which i have an hundred in my cell  
tragedy is to say a certain story  
as olde bookes maken us memory  
of him that stood in great prosperity  
and is y fallen out of high degree 
in misery  and endeth wretchedly  
and they be versified commonly 
of six feet  which men call hexametron  
in prose eke be indited many a one  
and eke in metre  in many a sundry wise  
lo  this declaring ought enough suffice  
now hearken  if ye like for to hear  
but first i you beseech in this mattere  
though i by order telle not these things  
be it of popes  emperors  or kings  
after their ages  as men written find  
but tell them some before and some behind  
as it now cometh to my remembrance  
have me excused of mine ignorance   
 
the tale  
 
i will bewail  in manner of tragedy  
the harm of them that stood in high degree  
and felle so  that there was no remedy 
to bring them out of their adversity  
for  certain  when that fortune list to flee  
there may no man the course of her wheel hold  
let no man trust in blind prosperity  
beware by these examples true and old  
at lucifer  though he an angel were  
and not a man  at him i will begin  
for though fortune may no angel dere  
from high degree yet fell he for his sin 
down into hell  where as he yet is in  
o lucifer  brightest of angels all  
now art thou satanas  that may st not twin 
out of the misery in which thou art fall  
lo adam  in the field of damascene 
with godde s owen finger wrought was he  
and not begotten of man s sperm unclean  
and welt all paradise saving one tree  
had never worldly man so high degree 
as adam  till he for misgovernance 
was driven out of his prosperity 
to labour  and to hell  and to mischance  
lo sampson  which that was annunciate 
by the angel  long ere his nativity  
and was to god almighty consecrate  
and stood in nobless while that he might see  
was never such another as was he  
to speak of strength  and thereto hardiness  
but to his wives told he his secre  
through which he slew himself for wretchedness  
sampson  this noble and mighty champion  
withoute weapon  save his handes tway  
he slew and all to rente the lion  
toward his wedding walking by the way  
his false wife could him so please  and pray  
till she his counsel knew  and she  untrue  
unto his foes his counsel gan bewray  
and him forsook  and took another new  
three hundred foxes sampson took for ire  
and all their tailes he together band  
and set the foxes  tailes all on fire  
for he in every tail had knit a brand  
and they burnt all the combs of that lend  
and all their oliveres and vines eke  
a thousand men he slew eke with his hand  
and had no weapon but an ass s cheek  
when they were slain  so thirsted him  that he 
was well nigh lorn  for which he gan to pray 
that god would on his pain have some pity  
and send him drink  or elles must he die  
and of this ass s check  that was so dry  
out of a wang tooth sprang anon a well  
of which  he drank enough  shortly to say  
thus help d him god  as judicum can tell  
by very force  at gaza  on a night  
maugre the philistines of that city  
the gates of the town he hath up plight  
and on his back y carried them hath he 
high on an hill  where as men might them see  
o noble mighty sampson  lefe and dear  
hadst thou not told to women thy secre  
in all this world there had not been thy peer  
this sampson never cider drank nor wine  
nor on his head came razor none nor shear  
by precept of the messenger divine  
for all his strengthes in his haires were  
and fully twenty winters  year by year  
he had of israel the governance  
but soone shall he weepe many a tear  
for women shall him bringe to mischance  
unto his leman dalila he told  
that in his haires all his strengthe lay  
and falsely to his foemen she him sold  
and sleeping in her barme upon a day 
she made to clip or shear his hair away  
and made his foemen all his craft espien  
and when they founde him in this array  
they bound him fast  and put out both his eyen  
but  ere his hair was clipped or y shave  
there was no bond with which men might him bind  
but now is he in prison in a cave  
where as they made him at the querne grind  
o noble sampson  strongest of mankind  
o whilom judge in glory and richess  
now may st thou weepe with thine eyen blind  
since thou from weal art fall n to wretchedness  
th end of this caitiff was as i shall say  
his foemen made a feast upon a day  
and made him as their fool before them play  
and this was in a temple of great array  
but at the last he made a foul affray  
for he two pillars shook  and made them fall  
and down fell temple and all  and there it lay  
and slew himself and eke his foemen all  
this is to say  the princes every one  
and eke three thousand bodies were there slain 
with falling of the great temple of stone  
of sampson now will i no more sayn  
beware by this example old and plain  
that no man tell his counsel to his wife 
of such thing as he would have secret fain  
if that it touch his limbes or his life  
of hercules the sov reign conquerour 
singe his workes  land and high renown  
for in his time of strength he bare the flow r  
he slew and reft the skin of the lion 
he of the centaurs laid the boast adown  
he harpies slew  the cruel birdes fell  
he golden apples reft from the dragon 
he drew out cerberus the hound of hell  
he slew the cruel tyrant busirus  
and made his horse to fret him flesh and bone  
he slew the fiery serpent venomous  
of achelous  two hornes brake he one  
and he slew cacus in a cave of stone  
he slew the giant antaeus the strong  
he slew the grisly boar  and that anon  
and bare the heav n upon his necke long  
was never wight  since that the world began  
that slew so many monsters as did he  
throughout the wide world his name ran  
what for his strength  and for his high bounte  
and every realme went he for to see  
he was so strong that no man might him let  
at both the worlde s ends  as saith trophee  
instead of boundes he a pillar set  
a leman had this noble champion  
that highte dejanira  fresh as may  
and  as these clerkes make mention  
she hath him sent a shirte fresh and gay  
alas  this shirt  alas and well away  
envenomed was subtilly withal  
that ere that he had worn it half a day  
it made his flesh all from his bones fall  
but natheless some clerkes her excuse 
by one  that highte nessus  that it maked  
be as he may  i will not her accuse  
but on his back this shirt he wore all naked  
till that his flesh was for the venom blaked  ened 
and when he saw none other remedy  
in hote coals he hath himselfe raked  
for with no venom deigned he to die  
thus sterf this worthy mighty hercules  
lo  who may trust on fortune any throw  
for him that followeth all this world of pres  
ere he be ware  is often laid full low  
full wise is he that can himselfe know  
beware  for when that fortune list to glose 
then waiteth she her man to overthrow  
by such a way as he would least suppose  
the mighty throne  the precious treasor  
the glorious sceptre  and royal majesty  
that had the king nabuchodonosor 
with tongue unnethes may described be  
he twice won jerusalem the city  
the vessels of the temple he with him lad  
at babylone was his sov reign see  
in which his glory and delight he had  
the fairest children of the blood royal 
of israel he did do geld anon  
and maked each of them to be his thrall  
amonges others daniel was one  
that was the wisest child of every one  
for he the dreames of the king expounded  
where in chaldaea clerkes was there none 
that wiste to what fine his dreames sounded  
this proude king let make a statue of gold 
sixty cubites long  and seven in bread   
to which image hathe young and old 
commanded he to lout  and have in dread  
or in a furnace  full of flames red  
he should be burnt that woulde not obey  
but never would assente to that deed 
daniel  nor his younge fellows tway  
this king of kinges proud was and elate  
he ween d that god  that sits in majesty  
mighte him not bereave of his estate  
but suddenly he lost his dignity  
and like a beast he seemed for to be  
and ate hay as an ox  and lay thereout 
in rain  with wilde beastes walked he  
till certain time was y come about  
and like an eagle s feathers wax d his hairs  
his nailes like a birde s clawes were  
till god released him at certain years  
and gave him wit  and then with many a tear 
he thanked god  and ever his life in fear 
was he to do amiss  or more trespace  
and till that time he laid was on his bier  
he knew that god was full of might and grace  
his sone  which that highte balthasar  
that held the regne after his father s day  
he by his father coulde not beware  
for proud he was of heart and of array  
and eke an idolaster was he aye  
his high estate assured him in pride  
but fortune cast him down  and there he lay  
and suddenly his regne gan divide  
a feast he made unto his lordes all 
upon a time  and made them blithe be  
and then his officeres gan he call  
 go  bringe forth the vessels   saide he  
 which that my father in his prosperity 
out of the temple of jerusalem reft  
and to our highe goddes thanks we 
of honour  that our elders with us left   
his wife  his lordes  and his concubines 
aye dranke  while their appetites did last  
out of these noble vessels sundry wines  
and on a wall this king his eyen cast  
and saw an hand  armless  that wrote full fast  
for fear of which he quaked  and sighed sore  
this hand  that balthasar so sore aghast  
wrote mane  tekel  phares  and no more  
in all that land magician was there none 
that could expounde what this letter meant  
but daniel expounded it anon  
and said   o king  god to thy father lent 
glory and honour  regne  treasure  rent  
and he was proud  and nothing god he drad  
and therefore god great wreche upon him sent  
and him bereft the regne that he had  
 he was cast out of manne s company  
with asses was his habitation 
and ate hay  as a beast  in wet and dry  
till that he knew by grace and by reason 
that god of heaven hath domination 
o er every regne  and every creature  
and then had god of him compassion  
and him restor d his regne and his figure  
 eke thou  that art his son  art proud also  
and knowest all these thinges verily  
and art rebel to god  and art his foe  
thou drankest of his vessels boldely  
thy wife eke  and thy wenches  sinfully 
drank of the same vessels sundry wines  
and heried false goddes cursedly  
therefore to thee y shapen full great pine is  
 
 this hand was sent from god  that on the wall 
wrote mane  tekel  phares  truste me  
thy reign is done  thou weighest naught at all  
divided is thy regne  and it shall be 
to medes and to persians giv n   quoth he  
and thilke same night this king was slaw 
and darius occupied his degree  
though he thereto had neither right nor law  
lordings  example hereby may ye take  
how that in lordship is no sickerness  
for when that fortune will a man forsake  
she bears away his regne and his richess  
and eke his friendes bothe more and less  
for what man that hath friendes through fortune  
mishap will make them enemies  i guess  
this proverb is full sooth  and full commune  
zenobia  of palmyrie the queen  
as write persians of her nobless  
so worthy was in armes  and so keen  
that no wight passed her in hardiness  
nor in lineage  nor other gentleness  
of the king s blood of perse is she descended  
i say not that she hadde most fairness  
but of her shape she might not he amended  
from her childhood i finde that she fled 
office of woman  and to woods she went  
and many a wilde harte s blood she shed 
with arrows broad that she against them sent  
she was so swift  that she anon them hent  
and when that she was older  she would kill 
lions  leopards  and beares all to rent  
and in her armes wield them at her will  
she durst the wilde beastes  dennes seek  
and runnen in the mountains all the night  
and sleep under a bush  and she could eke 
wrestle by very force and very might 
with any young man  were he ne er so wight  
there mighte nothing in her armes stond  
she kept her maidenhood from every wight  
to no man deigned she for to be bond  
but at the last her friendes have her married 
to odenate  a prince of that country  
all were it so  that she them longe tarried  
and ye shall understande how that he 
hadde such fantasies as hadde she  
but natheless  when they were knit in fere  
they liv d in joy  and in felicity  
for each of them had other lefe and dear  
save one thing  that she never would assent  
by no way  that he shoulde by her lie 
but ones  for it was her plain intent 
to have a child  the world to multiply  
and all so soon as that she might espy 
that she was not with childe by that deed  
then would she suffer him do his fantasy 
eftsoon  and not but ones  
and if she were with child at thilke cast  
no more should he playe thilke game 
till fully forty dayes were past  
then would she once suffer him do the same  
all were this odenatus wild or tame  
he got no more of her  for thus she said  
it was to wives lechery and shame 
in other case if that men with them play d  
two sones  by this odenate had she  
the which she kept in virtue and lettrure  
but now unto our tale turne we  
i say  so worshipful a creature  
and wise therewith  and large with measure  
so penible in the war  and courteous eke  
nor more labour might in war endure  
was none  though all this worlde men should seek  
her rich array it mighte not be told  
as well in vessel as in her clothing  
she was all clad in pierrie and in gold 
and eke she lefte not  for no hunting  
to have of sundry tongues full knowing  
when that she leisure had  and for t intend 
to learne bookes was all her liking  
how she in virtue might her life dispend  
and  shortly of this story for to treat  
so doughty was her husband and eke she  
that they conquered many regnes great 
in th orient  with many a fair city 
appertinent unto the majesty 
of rome  and with strong hande held them fast  
nor ever might their foemen do them flee  
aye while that odenatus  dayes last   
her battles  whoso list them for to read  
against sapor the king  and other mo   
and how that all this process fell in deed  
why she conquer d  and what title thereto  
and after of her mischief and her woe  
how that she was besieged and y take  
let him unto my master petrarch go  
that writes enough of this  i undertake  
when odenate was dead  she mightily 
the regne held  and with her proper hand 
against her foes she fought so cruelly  
that there n as king nor prince in all that land  
that was not glad  if be that grace fand 
that she would not upon his land warray  
with her they maden alliance by bond  
to be in peace  and let her ride and play  
the emperor of rome  claudius  
nor  him before  the roman gallien  
durste never be so courageous  
nor no armenian  nor egyptien  
nor syrian  nor no arabien  
within the fielde durste with her fight  
lest that she would them with her handes slen  
or with her meinie putte them to flight  
in kinges  habit went her sones two  
as heires of their father s regnes all  
and heremanno and timolao 
their names were  as persians them call 
but aye fortune hath in her honey gall  
this mighty queene may no while endure  
fortune out of her regne made her fall 
to wretchedness and to misadventure  
aurelian  when that the governance 
of rome came into his handes tway  
he shope upon this queen to do vengeance  
and with his legions he took his way 
toward zenobie  and  shortly for to say  
he made her flee  and at the last her hent  
and fetter d her  and eke her children tway  
and won the land  and home to rome he went  
amonges other thinges that he wan  
her car  that was with gold wrought and pierrie  
this greate roman  this aurelian 
hath with him led  for that men should it see  
before in his triumphe walked she 
with gilte chains upon her neck hanging  
crowned she was  as after her degree  
and full of pierrie her clothing  
alas  fortune  she that whilom was 
dreadful to kinges and to emperours  
now galeth all the people on her  alas  
and she that helmed was in starke stowres  
and won by force townes strong and tow rs  
shall on her head now wear a vitremite  
and she that bare the sceptre full of flow rs 
shall bear a distaff  her cost for to quite  
although that nero were so vicious 
as any fiend that lies full low adown  
yet he  as telleth us suetonius  
this wide world had in subjectioun  
both east and west  south and septentrioun  
of rubies  sapphires  and of pearles white 
were all his clothes embroider d up and down  
for he in gemmes greatly gan delight  
more delicate  more pompous of array  
more proud  was never emperor than he  
that ilke cloth that he had worn one day  
after that time he would it never see  
nettes of gold thread had he great plenty  
to fish in tiber  when him list to play  
his lustes were as law  in his degree  
for fortune as his friend would him obey  
he rome burnt for his delicacy  
the senators he slew upon a day  
to heare how that men would weep and cry  
and slew his brother  and by his sister lay  
his mother made he in piteous array  
for he her wombe slitte  to behold 
where he conceived was  so well away  
that he so little of his mother told  
no tear out of his eyen for that sight 
came  but he said  a fair woman was she  
great wonder is  how that he could or might 
be doomesman of her deade beauty  
the wine to bringe him commanded he  
and drank anon  none other woe he made  
when might is joined unto cruelty  
alas  too deepe will the venom wade  
in youth a master had this emperour  
to teache him lettrure and courtesy  
for of morality he was the flow r  
as in his time  but if bookes lie  
and while this master had of him mast ry  
he made him so conning and so souple  
that longe time it was ere tyranny  
or any vice  durst in him uncouple  
this seneca  of which that i devise  
because nero had of him suche dread  
for he from vices would him aye chastise 
discreetly  as by word  and not by deed  
 sir   he would say   an emperor must need 
be virtuous  and hate tyranny   
for which he made him in a bath to bleed 
on both his armes  till he muste die  
this nero had eke of a custumance 
in youth against his master for to rise  
which afterward he thought a great grievance  
therefore he made him dien in this wise  
but natheless this seneca the wise 
chose in a bath to die in this mannere  
rather than have another tormentise  
and thus hath nero slain his master dear  
now fell it so  that fortune list no longer 
the highe pride of nero to cherice  
for though he were strong  yet was she stronger  
she thoughte thus   by god  i am too nice 
to set a man  that is full fill d of vice  
in high degree  and emperor him call  
by god  out of his seat i will him trice  
when he least weeneth  soonest shall he fall   
the people rose upon him on a night  
for his default  and when he it espied  
out of his doors anon he hath him dight 
alone  and where he ween d t have been allied  
he knocked fast  and aye the more he cried friendship 
the faster shutte they their doores all  
then wist he well he had himself misgied  
and went his way  no longer durst he call  
the people cried and rumbled up and down  
that with his eares heard he how they said  
 where is this false tyrant  this neroun   
for fear almost out of his wit he braid  
and to his goddes piteously he pray d 
for succour  but it mighte not betide 
for dread of this he thoughte that died  
and ran into a garden him to hide  
and in this garden found he churles tway  
that satte by a fire great and red  
and to these churles two he gan to pray 
to slay him  and to girdon off his head  
that to his body  when that he were dead  
were no despite done for his defame  
himself he slew  he coud no better rede  
of which fortune laugh d and hadde game  
was never capitain under a king  
that regnes more put in subjectioun  
nor stronger was in field of alle thing 
as in his time  nor greater of renown  
nor more pompous in high presumptioun  
than holofernes  whom fortune aye kiss d 
so lik rously  and led him up and down  
till that his head was off ere that he wist  
not only that this world had of him awe  
for losing of richess and liberty  
but he made every man reny his law  
nabuchodonosor was god  said he  
none other godde should honoured be  
against his hest there dare no wight trespace  
save in bethulia  a strong city  
where eliachim priest was of that place  
but take keep of the death of holofern  ice 
amid his host he drunken lay at night 
within his tente  large as is a bern  
and yet  for all his pomp and all his might  
judith  a woman  as he lay upright 
sleeping  his head off smote  and from his tent 
full privily she stole from every wight  
and with his head unto her town she went  
what needeth it of king antiochus 
to tell his high and royal majesty  
his great pride  and his workes venomous  
for such another was there none as he  
reade what that he was in maccabee  
and read the proude wordes that he said  
and why he fell from his prosperity  
and in an hill how wretchedly he died  
fortune him had enhanced so in pride  
that verily he ween d he might attain 
unto the starres upon every side  
and in a balance weighen each mountain  
and all the floodes of the sea restrain  
and godde s people had he most in hate 
them would he slay in torment and in pain  
weening that god might not his pride abate  
and for that nicanor and timothee 
with jewes were vanquish d mightily  
unto the jewes such an hate had he  
that he bade graith his car full hastily  
and swore and saide full dispiteously  
unto jerusalem he would eftsoon  
to wreak his ire on it full cruelly 
but of his purpose was he let full soon  
god for his menace him so sore smote  
with invisible wound incurable  
that in his guttes carf it so and bote  
till that his paines were importable  
and certainly the wreche was reasonable  
for many a manne s guttes did he pain  
but from his purpose  curs d and damnable  
for all his smart he would him not restrain  
but bade anon apparaile his host  
and suddenly  ere he was of it ware  
god daunted all his pride  and all his boast 
for he so sore fell out of his chare  
that it his limbes and his skin to tare  
so that he neither mighte go nor ride 
but in a chaire men about him bare  
alle forbruised bothe back and side  
the wreche of god him smote so cruelly  
that through his body wicked wormes crept  
and therewithal he stank so horribly 
that none of all his meinie that him kept  
whether so that he woke or elles slept  
ne mighte not of him the stink endure  
in this mischief he wailed and eke wept  
and knew god lord of every creature  
to all his host  and to himself also  
full wlatsem was the stink of his carrain  
no manne might him beare to and fro  
and in this stink  and this horrible pain  
he starf full wretchedly in a mountain  
thus hath this robber  and this homicide  
that many a manne made to weep and plain  
such guerdon as belongeth unto pride  
the story of alexander is so commune  
that ev ry wight that hath discretion 
hath heard somewhat or all of his fortune  
this wide world  as in conclusion  
he won by strength  or  for his high renown  
they were glad for peace to him to send  
the pride and boast of man he laid adown  
whereso he came  unto the worlde s end  
comparison yet never might be maked 
between him and another conqueror  
for all this world for dread of him had quaked 
he was of knighthood and of freedom flow r  
fortune him made the heir of her honour  
save wine and women  nothing might assuage 
his high intent in arms and labour  
so was he full of leonine courage  
what praise were it to him  though i you told 
of darius  and a hundred thousand mo   
of kinges  princes  dukes  and earles bold  
which he conquer d  and brought them into woe  
i say  as far as man may ride or go  
the world was his  why should i more devise  
for  though i wrote or told you evermo   
of his knighthood it mighte not suffice  
twelve years he reigned  as saith maccabee 
philippe s son of macedon he was  
that first was king in greece the country  
o worthy gentle alexander  alas 
that ever should thee falle such a case  
empoison d of thine owen folk thou were  
thy six fortune hath turn d into an ace  
and yet for thee she wepte never a tear  
who shall me give teares to complain 
the death of gentiless  and of franchise  
that all this worlde had in his demaine  
and yet he thought it mighte not suffice  
so full was his corage of high emprise  
alas  who shall me helpe to indite 
false fortune  and poison to despise  
the whiche two of all this woe i wite  
by wisdom  manhood  and by great labour  
from humbleness to royal majesty 
up rose he  julius the conquerour  
that won all th  occident  by land and sea  
by strength of hand or elles by treaty  
and unto rome made them tributary  
and since of rome the emperor was he  
till that fortune wax d his adversary  
o mighty caesar  that in thessaly 
against pompeius  father thine in law  
that of th  orient had all the chivalry  
as far as that the day begins to daw  
that through thy knighthood hast them take and slaw  
save fewe folk that with pompeius fled  
through which thou put all th  orient in awe  
thanke fortune that so well thee sped  
but now a little while i will bewail 
this pompeius  this noble governor 
of rome  which that fled at this battaile 
i say  one of his men  a false traitor  
his head off smote  to winne him favor 
of julius  and him the head he brought  
alas  pompey  of th  orient conqueror  
that fortune unto such a fine thee brought  
to rome again repaired julius  
with his triumphe laureate full high  
but on a time brutus and cassius  
that ever had of his estate envy  
full privily have made conspiracy 
against this julius in subtle wise 
and cast the place in which he shoulde die  
with bodekins  as i shall you devise  
this julius to the capitole went 
upon a day  as he was wont to gon  
and in the capitol anon him hent 
this false brutus  and his other fone  
and sticked him with bodekins anon 
with many a wound  and thus they let him lie  
but never groan d he at no stroke but one  
or else at two  but if the story lie  
so manly was this julius of heart  
and so well loved estately honesty 
that  though his deadly woundes sore smart  
his mantle o er his hippes caste he  
that ne man shoulde see his privity 
and as he lay a dying in a trance  
and wiste verily that dead was he  
of honesty yet had he remembrance  
lucan  to thee this story i recommend  
and to sueton   and valerie also  
that of this story write word and end 
how that to these great conquerores two 
fortune was first a friend  and since a foe  
no manne trust upon her favour long  
but have her in await for evermo   
witness on all these conquerores strong  
the riche croesus  whilom king of lyde    
of which croesus cyrus him sore drad    
yet was he caught amiddes all his pride  
and to be burnt men to the fire him lad  
but such a rain down from the welkin shad  
that slew the fire  and made him to escape  
but to beware no grace yet he had  
till fortune on the gallows made him gape  
when he escaped was  he could not stint 
for to begin a newe war again  
he weened well  for that fortune him sent 
such hap  that he escaped through the rain  
that of his foes he mighte not be slain  
and eke a sweven on a night he mette  
of which he was so proud  and eke so fain  
that he in vengeance all his hearte set  
upon a tree he was set  as he thought  
where jupiter him wash d  both back and side  
and phoebus eke a fair towel him brought 
to dry him with  and therefore wax d his pride  
and to his daughter that stood him beside  
which he knew in high science to abound  
he bade her tell him what it signified  
and she his dream began right thus expound  
 the tree   quoth she   the gallows is to mean  
and jupiter betokens snow and rain  
and phoebus  with his towel clear and clean  
these be the sunne s streames sooth to sayn  
thou shalt y hangeth be  father  certain  
rain shall thee wash  and sunne shall thee dry   
thus warned him full plat and eke full plain 
his daughter  which that called was phanie  
and hanged was croesus the proude king  
his royal throne might him not avail  
tragedy is none other manner thing  
nor can in singing crien nor bewail  
but for that fortune all day will assail 
with unware stroke the regnes that be proud  
for when men truste her  then will she fail  
and cover her bright face with a cloud  
o noble  o worthy pedro  glory of spain  
whem fortune held so high in majesty  
well oughte men thy piteous death complain  
out of thy land thy brother made thee flee  
and after  at a siege  by subtlety  
thou wert betray d  and led unto his tent  
where as he with his owen hand slew thee  
succeeding in thy regne and in thy rent

caught with the lion  red colour d as the glede

had on him made a false suggestion  
through which the people gan upon him rise  
and put him in prison  in such a wise 
as ye have heard  and meat and drink he had 
so small  that well unneth it might suffice  
and therewithal it was full poor and bad  
and on a day befell  that in that hour 
when that his meate wont was to be brought  
the jailor shut the doores of the tow r  
he heard it right well  but he spake nought  
and in his heart anon there fell a thought  
that they for hunger woulde him dien  
 alas   quoth he   alas that i was wrought   
therewith the teares fell from his eyen  
his youngest son  that three years was of age  
unto him said   father  why do ye weep  
when will the jailor bringen our pottage  
is there no morsel bread that ye do keep  
i am so hungry  that i may not sleep  
now woulde god that i might sleepen ever  
then should not hunger in my wombe creep  
there is no thing  save bread  that one were lever   
thus day by day this child begun to cry  
till in his father s barme adown he lay  
and saide   farewell  father  i must die   
and kiss d his father  and died the same day  
and when the woeful father did it sey  
for woe his armes two he gan to bite  
and said   alas  fortune  and well away  
to thy false wheel my woe all may i wite   
his children ween d that it for hunger was 
that he his armes gnaw d  and not for woe  
and saide   father  do not so  alas  
but rather eat the flesh upon us two  
our flesh thou gave us  our flesh take us fro   
and eat enough   right thus they to him said  
and after that  within a day or two  
they laid them in his lap adown  and died  
himself  despaired  eke for hunger starf  
thus ended is this earl of pise  
from high estate fortune away him carf  
of this tragedy it ought enough suffice 
whoso will hear it in a longer wise  
reade the greate poet of ltale  
that dante hight  for he can it devise 
from point to point  not one word will he fail  
 
the nun s priest s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
 ho   quoth the knight   good sir  no more of this  
that ye have said is right enough  y wis  
and muche more  for little heaviness 
is right enough to muche folk  i guess  
i say for me  it is a great disease  
where as men have been in great wealth and ease  
to hearen of their sudden fall  alas  
and the contrary is joy and great solas  
as when a man hath been in poor estate  
and climbeth up  and waxeth fortunate  
and there abideth in prosperity  
such thing is gladsome  as it thinketh me  
and of such thing were goodly for to tell   
 yea   quoth our hoste   by saint paule s bell  
ye say right sooth  this monk hath clapped loud  
he spake how fortune cover d with a cloud 
i wot not what  and als  of a tragedy 
right now ye heard  and pardie no remedy 
it is for to bewaile  nor complain 
that that is done  and also it is pain  
as ye have said  to hear of heaviness  
sir monk  no more of this  so god you bless  
your tale annoyeth all this company  
such talking is not worth a butterfly  
for therein is there no sport nor game  
therefore  sir monke  dan piers by your name  
i pray you heart ly  tell us somewhat else  
for sickerly  n ere clinking of your bells  
that on your bridle hang on every side  
by heaven s king  that for us alle died  
i should ere this have fallen down for sleep  
although the slough had been never so deep  
then had your tale been all told in vain  
for certainly  as these clerkes sayn  
where as a man may have no audience  
nought helpeth it to telle his sentence  
and well i wot the substance is in me  
if anything shall well reported be  
sir  say somewhat of hunting  i you pray   
 nay   quoth the monk   i have no lust to play  
now let another tell  as i have told   jesting 
then spake our host with rude speech and bold  
and said unto the nunne s priest anon  
 come near  thou priest  come hither  thou sir john  
tell us such thing as may our heartes glade  den 
be blithe  although thou ride upon a jade  
what though thine horse be bothe foul and lean  
if he will serve thee  reck thou not a bean  
look that thine heart be merry evermo    
 yes  host   quoth he   so may i ride or go  
but i be merry  y wis i will be blamed   
and right anon his tale he hath attamed commenced 
and thus he said unto us every one  
this sweete priest  this goodly man  sir john  
 
the tale  
 
a poor widow  somedeal y stept in age  
was whilom dwelling in a poor cottage  
beside a grove  standing in a dale  
this widow  of which i telle you my tale  
since thilke day that she was last a wife  
in patience led a full simple life  
for little was her chattel and her rent  
by husbandry of such as god her sent  
she found herself  and eke her daughters two  
three large sowes had she  and no mo   
three kine  and eke a sheep that highte mall  
full sooty was her bow r  and eke her hall  
in which she ate full many a slender meal  
of poignant sauce knew she never a deal  
no dainty morsel passed through her throat  
her diet was accordant to her cote  
repletion her made never sick  
attemper diet was all her physic  
and exercise  and hearte s suffisance  
the goute let her nothing for to dance  
nor apoplexy shente not her head  
no wine drank she  neither white nor red  
her board was served most with white and black  
milk and brown bread  in which she found no lack  
seind bacon  and sometimes an egg or tway  
for she was as it were a manner dey  
a yard she had  enclosed all about 
with stickes  and a drye ditch without  
in which she had a cock  hight chanticleer  
in all the land of crowing n as his peer  
his voice was merrier than the merry orgon  
on masse days that in the churches gon  
well sickerer was his crowing in his lodge  
than is a clock  or an abbay horloge  
by nature he knew each ascension 
of th  equinoctial in thilke town  
for when degrees fiftene were ascended  
then crew he  that it might not be amended  
his comb was redder than the fine coral  
embattell d as it were a castle wall  
his bill was black  and as the jet it shone  
like azure were his legges and his tone  
his nailes whiter than the lily flow r  
and like the burnish d gold was his colour  
this gentle cock had in his governance 
sev n hennes  for to do all his pleasance  
which were his sisters and his paramours  
and wondrous like to him as of colours  
of which the fairest hued in the throat 
was called damoselle partelote  
courteous she was  discreet  and debonair  
and companiable  and bare herself so fair  
since the day that she sev n night was old  
that truely she had the heart in hold 
of chanticleer  locked in every lith  
he lov d her so  that well was him therewith  
but such a joy it was to hear them sing  
when that the brighte sunne gan to spring  
in sweet accord   my lefe is fare in land   
for  at that time  as i have understand  gone abroad 
beastes and birdes coulde speak and sing  
and so befell  that in a dawening  
as chanticleer among his wives all 
sat on his perche  that was in the hall  
and next him sat this faire partelote  
this chanticleer gan groanen in his throat  
as man that in his dream is dretched sore  
and when that partelote thus heard him roar  
she was aghast  and saide   hearte dear  
what aileth you to groan in this mannere  
ye be a very sleeper  fy for shame   
and he answer d and saide thus   madame  
i pray you that ye take it not agrief  
by god  mette i was in such mischief  
right now  that yet mine heart is sore affright   
now god   quoth he   my sweven read aright 
and keep my body out of foul prisoun  
me mette  how that i roamed up and down 
within our yard  where as i saw a beast 
was like an hound  and would have made arrest 
upon my body  and would have had me dead  
his colour was betwixt yellow and red  
and tipped was his tail  and both his ears  
with black  unlike the remnant of his hairs  
his snout was small  with glowing eyen tway  
yet of his look almost for fear i dey  
this caused me my groaning  doubteless   
 away   quoth she   fy on you  hearteless  
alas   quoth she   for  by that god above  
now have ye lost my heart and all my love  
i cannot love a coward  by my faith  
for certes  what so any woman saith  
we all desiren  if it mighte be  
to have husbandes hardy  wise  and free  
and secret  and no niggard nor no fool  
nor him that is aghast of every tool  
nor no avantour  by that god above  
how durste ye for shame say to your love 
that anything might make you afear d  
have ye no manne s heart  and have a beard  
alas  and can ye be aghast of swevenes  
nothing but vanity  god wot  in sweven is  
swevens engender of repletions  
and oft of fume  and of complexions  
when humours be too abundant in a wight  
certes this dream  which ye have mette tonight  
cometh of the great supefluity 
of youre rede cholera  pardie  
which causeth folk to dreaden in their dreams 
of arrows  and of fire with redde beams  
of redde beastes  that they will them bite  
of conteke  and of whelpes great and lite  
right as the humour of melancholy 
causeth full many a man in sleep to cry  
for fear of bulles  or of beares blake  
or elles that black devils will them take  
of other humours could i tell also  
that worke many a man in sleep much woe  
that i will pass as lightly as i can  
lo  cato  which that was so wise a man  
said he not thus   ne do no force of dreams   
now  sir   quoth she   when we fly from these beams  
for godde s love  as take some laxatife  
on peril of my soul  and of my life  
i counsel you the best  i will not lie  
that both of choler  and melancholy  
ye purge you  and  for ye shall not tarry  
though in this town is no apothecary  
i shall myself two herbes teache you  
that shall be for your health  and for your prow  
and in our yard the herbes shall i find  
the which have of their property by kind 
to purge you beneath  and eke above  
sire  forget not this for godde s love  
ye be full choleric of complexion  
ware that the sun  in his ascension  
you finde not replete of humours hot  
and if it do  i dare well lay a groat  
that ye shall have a fever tertiane  
or else an ague  that may be your bane  
a day or two ye shall have digestives 
of wormes  ere ye take your laxatives  
of laurel  centaury  and fumeterere  
or else of elder berry  that groweth there  
of catapuce  or of the gaitre berries  
or herb ivy growing in our yard  that merry is  
pick them right as they grow  and eat them in  
be merry  husband  for your father s kin  
dreade no dream  i can say you no more   
 madame   quoth he   grand mercy of your lore  
but natheless  as touching dan catoun  
that hath of wisdom such a great renown  
though that he bade no dreames for to dread  
by god  men may in olde bookes read 
of many a man more of authority 
than ever cato was  so may i the  
that all the reverse say of his sentence  
and have well founden by experience 
that dreames be significations 
as well of joy  as tribulations 
that folk enduren in this life present  
there needeth make of this no argument  
the very preve sheweth it indeed  
one of the greatest authors that men read 
saith thus  that whilom two fellowes went 
on pilgrimage in a full good intent  
and happen d so  they came into a town 
where there was such a congregatioun 
of people  and eke so strait of herbergage  
that they found not as much as one cottage 
in which they bothe might y lodged be  
wherefore they musten of necessity  
as for that night  departe company  
and each of them went to his hostelry  
and took his lodging as it woulde fall  
the one of them was lodged in a stall  
far in a yard  with oxen of the plough  
that other man was lodged well enow  
as was his aventure  or his fortune  
that us governeth all  as in commune  
and so befell  that  long ere it were day  
this man mette in his bed  there  as he lay  
how that his fellow gan upon him call  
and said   alas  for in an ox s stall 
this night shall i be murder d  where i lie 
now help me  deare brother  or i die  
in alle haste come to me   he said  
this man out of his sleep for fear abraid  
but when that he was wak d out of his sleep  
he turned him  and of this no keep  
he thought his dream was but a vanity  
thus twies in his sleeping dreamed he  
and at the thirde time yet his fellaw again 
came  as he thought  and said   i am now slaw  
behold my bloody woundes  deep and wide  
arise up early  in the morning  tide  
and at the west gate of the town   quoth he  
 a carte full of dung there shalt  thou see  
in which my body is hid privily  
do thilke cart arroste boldely  
my gold caused my murder  sooth to sayn   
and told him every point how he was slain  
with a full piteous face  and pale of hue  
 and  truste well  his dream he found full true  
for on the morrow  as soon as it was day  
to his fellowes inn he took his way  
and when that he came to this ox s stall  
after his fellow he began to call  
the hostelere answered him anon  
and saide   sir  your fellow is y gone  
as soon as day he went out of the town   
this man gan fallen in suspicioun  
rememb ring on his dreames that he mette  
and forth he went  no longer would he let  
unto the west gate of the town  and fand 
a dung cart  as it went for to dung land  
that was arrayed in the same wise 
as ye have heard the deade man devise  
and with an hardy heart he gan to cry  
 vengeance and justice of this felony  
my fellow murder d in this same night 
and in this cart he lies  gaping upright  
i cry out on the ministers   quoth he  
 that shoulde keep and rule this city  
harow  alas  here lies my fellow slain   
what should i more unto this tale sayn  
the people out start  and cast the cart to ground 
and in the middle of the dung they found 
the deade man  that murder d was all new  
o blissful god  that art so good and true  
lo  how that thou bewray st murder alway  
murder will out  that see we day by day  
murder is so wlatsom and abominable 
to god  that is so just and reasonable  
that he will not suffer it heled be  
though it abide a year  or two  or three  
murder will out  this is my conclusioun  
and right anon  the ministers of the town 
have hent the carter  and so sore him pined  
and eke the hostelere so sore engined  
that they beknew their wickedness anon  
and were hanged by the necke bone  
 here may ye see that dreames be to dread  
and certes in the same book i read  
right in the nexte chapter after this 
i gabbe not  so have i joy and bliss  
two men that would  have passed over sea  
for certain cause  into a far country  
if that the wind not hadde been contrary  
that made them in a city for to tarry  
that stood full merry upon an haven side  
but on a day  against the even tide  
the wind gan change  and blew right 
jolly and glad they wente to their rest  
and caste them full early for to sail  
but to the one man fell a great marvail 
that one of them  in sleeping as he lay  
he mette a wondrous dream  against the day  
he thought a man stood by his bedde s side  
and him commanded that he should abide  
and said him thus   if thou to morrow wend  
thou shalt be drown d  my tale is at an end   
he woke  and told his follow what he mette  
and prayed him his voyage for to let  
as for that day  he pray d him to abide  
his fellow  that lay by his bedde s side  
gan for to laugh  and scorned him full fast  
 no dream   quoth he  may so my heart aghast  
that i will lette for to do my things  
i sette not a straw by thy dreamings  
for swevens be but vanities and japes  
men dream all day of owles and of apes  
and eke of many a maze therewithal  
men dream of thing that never was  nor shall  
but since i see  that thou wilt here abide  
and thus forslothe wilfully thy tide  
god wot  it rueth me  and have good day   
and thus he took his leave  and went his way  
but  ere that he had half his course sail d  
i know not why  nor what mischance it ail d  
but casually the ship s bottom rent  
and ship and man under the water went  
in sight of other shippes there beside 
that with him sailed at the same tide  
 and therefore  faire partelote so dear  
by such examples olde may st thou lear  
that no man shoulde be too reckeless 
of dreames  for i say thee doubteless  
that many a dream full sore is for to dread  
lo  in the life of saint kenelm i read  
that was kenulphus  son  the noble king 
of mercenrike  how kenelm mette a thing  
a little ere he was murder d on a day  
his murder in his vision he say  
his norice him expounded every deal 
his sweven  and bade him to keep him well 
for treason  but he was but seven years old  
and therefore tale hath he told 
of any dream  so holy was his heart  
by god  i hadde lever than my shirt 
that ye had read his legend  as have i  
dame partelote  i say you truely  
macrobius  that wrote the vision 
in afric  of the worthy scipion  
affirmeth dreames  and saith that they be 
 warnings of thinges that men after see  
and furthermore  i pray you looke well 
in the old testament  of daniel  
if he held dreames any vanity  
read eke of joseph  and there shall ye see 
whether dreams be sometimes i say not all 
warnings of thinges that shall after fall  
look of egypt the king  dan pharaoh  
his baker and his buteler also  
whether they felte none effect in dreams  
whoso will seek the acts of sundry remes 
may read of dreames many a wondrous thing  
lo croesus  which that was of lydia king  
mette he not that he sat upon a tree  
which signified he shoulde hanged be  
lo here  andromache  hectore s wife  
that day that hector shoulde lose his life  
she dreamed on the same night beforn  
how that the life of hector should be lorn  
if thilke day he went into battaile  
she warned him  but it might not avail  
he wente forth to fighte natheless  
and was y slain anon of achilles  
but thilke tale is all too long to tell  
and eke it is nigh day  i may not dwell  
shortly i say  as for conclusion  
that i shall have of this avision 
adversity  and i say furthermore  
that i ne tell of laxatives no store  
for they be venomous  i wot it well  of no value 
i them defy  i love them never a del  
 but let us speak of mirth  and stint all this  
madame partelote  so have i bliss  
of one thing god hath sent me large grace  liberal 
for when i see the beauty of your face  
ye be so scarlet hued about your eyen  
i maketh all my dreade for to dien  
for  all so sicker as in principio  
mulier est hominis confusio  
madam  the sentence of of this latin is  
woman is manne s joy and manne s bliss  
for when i feel at night your softe side    
albeit that i may not on you ride  
for that our perch is made so narrow  alas  
i am so full of joy and of solas  
that i defy both sweven and eke dream   
and with that word he flew down from the beam  
for it was day  and eke his hennes all  
and with a chuck he gan them for to call  
for he had found a corn  lay in the yard  
royal he was  he was no more afear d  
he feather d partelote twenty time  
and as oft trode her  ere that it was prime  
he looked as it were a grim lion  
and on his toes he roamed up and down  
he deigned not to set his feet to ground  
he chucked  when he had a corn y found  
and to him ranne then his wives all  
thus royal  as a prince is in his hall  
leave i this chanticleer in his pasture  
and after will i tell his aventure  
when that the month in which the world began  
that highte march  when god first maked man  
was complete  and y passed were also  
since march ended  thirty days and two  
befell that chanticleer in all his pride  
his seven wives walking him beside  
cast up his eyen to the brighte sun  
that in the sign of taurus had y run 
twenty degrees and one  and somewhat more  
he knew by kind  and by none other lore  
that it was prime  and crew with blissful steven  
 the sun   he said   is clomben up in heaven 
twenty degrees and one  and more y wis  
madame partelote  my worlde s bliss  
hearken these blissful birdes how they sing  
and see the freshe flowers how they spring  
full is mine heart of revel and solace   
but suddenly him fell a sorrowful case  
for ever the latter end of joy is woe  
god wot that worldly joy is soon y go  
and  if a rhetor coulde fair indite  
he in a chronicle might it safely write  
as for a sov reign notability 
now every wise man  let him hearken me  
this story is all as true  i undertake  
as is the book of launcelot du lake  
that women hold in full great reverence  
now will i turn again to my sentence  
a col fox  full of sly iniquity  
that in the grove had wonned yeares three  
by high imagination forecast  
the same night thorough the hedges brast 
into the yard  where chanticleer the fair 
was wont  and eke his wives  to repair  
and in a bed of wortes still he lay  
till it was passed undern of the day  
waiting his time on chanticleer to fall  
as gladly do these homicides all  
that in awaite lie to murder men  
o false murd rer  rouking in thy den  
o new iscariot  new ganilion  
o false dissimuler  o greek sinon  
that broughtest troy all utterly to sorrow  
o chanticleer  accursed be the morrow 
that thou into thy yard flew from the beams  
thou wert full well y warned by thy dreams 
that thilke day was perilous to thee  
but what that god forewot must needes be  
after th  opinion of certain clerkes  
witness on him that any perfect clerk is  
that in school is great altercation 
in this matter  and great disputation  
and hath been of an hundred thousand men  
but i ne cannot boult it to the bren  
as can the holy doctor augustine  
or boece  or the bishop bradwardine  
whether that godde s worthy foreweeting 
straineth me needly for to do a thing 
needly call i simple necessity  
or elles if free choice be granted me 
to do that same thing  or do it not  
though god forewot it ere that it was wrought  
or if his weeting straineth never a deal  
but by necessity conditionel  
i will not have to do of such mattere  
my tale is of a cock  as ye may hear  
that took his counsel of his wife  with sorrow  
to walken in the yard upon the morrow 
that he had mette the dream  as i you told  
womane s counsels be full often cold  
womane s counsel brought us first to woe  
and made adam from paradise to go  
there as he was full merry and well at case  
but  for i n ot to whom i might displease 
if i counsel of women woulde blame  
pass over  for i said it in my game  
read authors  where they treat of such mattere 
and what they say of women ye may hear  
these be the cocke s wordes  and not mine  
i can no harm of no woman divine  
fair in the sand  to bathe her merrily  
lies partelote  and all her sisters by  
against the sun  and chanticleer so free 
sang merrier than the mermaid in the sea  
for physiologus saith sickerly  
how that they singe well and merrily  
and so befell that  as he cast his eye 
among the wortes  on a butterfly  
he was ware of this fox that lay full low  
nothing ne list him thenne for to crow  
but cried anon  cock  cock   and up he start  
as man that was affrayed in his heart  
for naturally a beast desireth flee 
from his contrary  if be may it see  
though he ne er erst had soon it with his eye 
this chanticleer  when he gan him espy  
he would have fled  but that the fox anon 
said   gentle sir  alas  why will ye gon  
be ye afraid of me that am your friend  
now  certes  i were worse than any fiend  
if i to you would harm or villainy  
i am not come your counsel to espy  
but truely the cause of my coming 
was only for to hearken how ye sing  
for truely ye have as merry a steven  
as any angel hath that is in heaven  
therewith ye have of music more feeling  
than had boece  or any that can sing  
my lord your father god his soule bless 
and eke your mother of her gentleness  
have in mnine house been  to my great ease  
and certes  sir  full fain would i you please  
but  for men speak of singing  i will say  
so may i brooke well mine eyen tway  
save you  i hearde never man so sing 
as did your father in the morrowning  
certes it was of heart all that he sung  
and  for to make his voice the more strong  
he would so pain him  that with both his eyen 
he muste wink  so loud he woulde cryen  
and standen on his tiptoes therewithal  
and stretche forth his necke long and small  
and eke he was of such discretion  
that there was no man  in no region  
that him in song or wisdom mighte pass  
i have well read in dan burnel the ass  
among his verse  how that there was a cock 
that  for a prieste s son gave him a knock 
upon his leg  while he was young and nice  
he made him for to lose his benefice  
but certain there is no comparison 
betwixt the wisdom and discretion 
of youre father  and his subtilty  
now singe  sir  for sainte charity  
let see  can ye your father counterfeit   
this chanticleer his wings began to beat  
as man that could not his treason espy  
so was he ravish d with his flattery  
alas  ye lordes  many a false flattour 
is in your court  and many a losengeour  
that please you well more  by my faith  
than he that soothfastness unto you saith  
read in ecclesiast  of flattery  
beware  ye lordes  of their treachery  
this chanticleer stood high upon his toes  
stretching his neck  and held his eyen close  
and gan to crowe loude for the nonce 
and dan russel the fox start up at once  
and by the gorge hente chanticleer  
and on his back toward the wood him bare  
for yet was there no man that him pursu d  
o destiny  that may st not be eschew d  
alas  that chanticleer flew from the beams  
alas  his wife raughte nought of dreams  
and on a friday fell all this mischance  
o venus  that art goddess of pleasance  
since that thy servant was this chanticleer 
and in thy service did all his powere  
more for delight  than the world to multiply  
why wilt thou suffer him on thy day to die  
o gaufrid  deare master sovereign  
that  when thy worthy king richard was slain 
with shot  complainedest his death so sore  
why n had i now thy sentence and thy lore  
the friday for to chiden  as did ye  
for on a friday  soothly  slain was he  
then would i shew you how that i could plain 
for chanticleere s dread  and for his pain  
certes such cry nor lamentation 
was ne er of ladies made  when ilion 
was won  and pyrrhus with his straighte sword  
when he had hent king priam by the beard  
and slain him as saith us eneidos  
as maden all the hennes in the close  
when they had seen of chanticleer the sight  
but sov reignly dame partelote shright  
full louder than did hasdrubale s wife  
when that her husband hadde lost his life  
and that the romans had y burnt carthage  
she was so full of torment and of rage  
that wilfully into the fire she start  
and burnt herselfe with a steadfast heart  
o woeful hennes  right so cried ye  
as  when that nero burned the city 
of rome  cried the senatores  wives  
for that their husbands losten all their lives  
withoute guilt this nero hath them slain  
now will i turn unto my tale again  
the sely widow  and her daughters two  
hearde these hennes cry and make woe  
and at the doors out started they anon  
and saw the fox toward the wood is gone  
and bare upon his back the cock away  
they cried   out  harow  and well away  
aha  the fox   and after him they ran  
and eke with staves many another man 
ran coll our dog  and talbot  and garland  
and malkin  with her distaff in her hand 
ran cow and calf  and eke the very hogges 
so fear d they were for barking of the dogges  
and shouting of the men and women eke  
they ranne so  them thought their hearts would break  
they yelled as the fiendes do in hell  
the duckes cried as men would them quell  
the geese for feare flewen o er the trees  
out of the hive came the swarm of bees  
so hideous was the noise  ben dicite  
certes he  jacke straw  and his meinie  
ne made never shoutes half so shrill 
when that they woulden any fleming kill  
as thilke day was made upon the fox  
of brass they broughte beames and of box  
of horn and bone  in which they blew and pooped  
and therewithal they shrieked and they hooped  
it seemed as the heaven shoulde fall 
now  goode men  i pray you hearken all  
lo  how fortune turneth suddenly 
the hope and pride eke of her enemy  
this cock  that lay upon the fox s back  
in all his dread unto the fox he spake  
and saide   sir  if that i were as ye  
yet would i say as wisly god help me  
 turn ye again  ye proude churles all  
a very pestilence upon you fall  
now am i come unto the woode s side  
maugre your head  the cock shall here abide  
i will him eat  in faith  and that anon    
the fox answer d   in faith it shall be done   
and  as he spake the word  all suddenly 
the cock brake from his mouth deliverly  
and high upon a tree he flew anon  
and when the fox saw that the cock was gone  
 alas   quoth he   o chanticleer  alas  
i have   quoth he   y done to you trespass  
inasmuch as i maked you afear d  
when i you hent  and brought out of your yard  
but  sir  i did it in no wick  intent  
come down  and i shall tell you what i meant  
i shall say sooth to you  god help me so   
 nay then   quoth he   i shrew us both the two  
and first i shrew myself  both blood and bones  
if thou beguile me oftener than once  
thou shalt no more through thy flattery 
do me to sing and winke with mine eye  
for he that winketh when he shoulde see  
all wilfully  god let him never the   
 nay   quoth the fox   but god give him mischance 
that is so indiscreet of governance  
that jangleth when that he should hold his peace   
lo  what it is for to be reckeless 
and negligent  and trust on flattery  
but ye that holde this tale a folly  
as of a fox  or of a cock or hen  
take the morality thereof  good men  
for saint paul saith  that all that written is  
to our doctrine it written is y wis  
take the fruit  and let the chaff be still  
now goode god  if that it be thy will  
as saith my lord  so make us all good men  
and bring us all to thy high bliss  amen  
 
the epilogue 
 
 sir nunne s priest   our hoste said anon  
 y blessed be thy breech  and every stone  
this was a merry tale of chanticleer  
but by my truth  if thou wert seculere  
thou wouldest be a treadefowl aright  
for if thou have courage as thou hast might  
thee were need of hennes  as i ween  
yea more than seven times seventeen  
see  whate brawnes hath this gentle priest  
so great a neck  and such a large breast 
he looketh as a sperhawk with his eyen 
him needeth not his colour for to dyen 
with brazil  nor with grain of portugale  
but  sir  faire fall you for your tale    
and  after that  he with full merry cheer 
said to another  as ye shall hear  
 
the second nun s tale 
 
the minister and norice unto vices

that is to say  by lawful business    
well oughte we to our all intent 
lest that the fiend through idleness us hent  
for he  that with his thousand cordes sly 
continually us waiteth to beclap  
when he may man in idleness espy  
he can so lightly catch him in his trap  
till that a man be hent right by the lappe  
he is not ware the fiend hath him in hand  
well ought we work  and idleness withstand  
and though men dreaded never for to die  
yet see men well by reason  doubteless  
that idleness is root of sluggardy  
of which there cometh never good increase  
and see that sloth them holdeth in a leas  
only to sleep  and for to eat and drink  
and to devouren all that others swink  
and  for to put us from such idleness  
that cause is of so great confusion  
i have here done my faithful business

yet pray i you  that reade what i write  
forgive me that i do no diligence 
this ilke story subtilly t  indite  
for both have i the wordes and sentence 
of him that at the sainte s reverence 
the story wrote  and follow her legend  
and pray you that you will my work amend  
first will i you the name of saint cecilie 
expound  as men may in her story see  
it is to say in english  heaven s lily  
for pure chasteness of virginity  
or  for she whiteness had of honesty  
and green of conscience  and of good fame 
the sweete savour  lilie was her name  
or cecilie is to say  the way of blind  
for she example was by good teaching  
or else cecilie  as i written find  
is joined by a manner conjoining 
of heaven and lia  and herein figuring 
the heaven is set for thought of holiness  
and lia for her lasting business  
cecilie may eke be said in this mannere  
wanting of blindness  for her greate light 
of sapience  and for her thewes clear  
or elles  lo  this maiden s name bright 
of heaven and leos comes  for which by right 
men might her well the heaven of people call  
example of good and wise workes all  
for leos people in english is to say  
and right as men may in the heaven see 
the sun and moon  and starres every way  
right so men ghostly  in this maiden free  ually 
sawen of faith the magnanimity  
and eke the clearness whole of sapience  
and sundry workes bright of excellence  
and right so as these philosophers write  
that heav n is swift and round  and eke burning  
right so was faire cecilie the white 
full swift and busy in every good working  
and round and whole in good persevering  
and burning ever in charity full bright  
now have i you declared what she hight  
this maiden bright cecile  as her life saith  
was come of romans  and of noble kind  
and from her cradle foster d in the faith 
of christ  and bare his gospel in her mind  
she never ceased  as i written find  
of her prayere  and god to love and dread  
beseeching him to keep her maidenhead  
and when this maiden should unto a man 
y wedded be  that was full young of age  
which that y called was valerian  
and come was the day of marriage  
she  full devout and humble in her corage  
under her robe of gold  that sat full fair  
had next her flesh y clad her in an hair  
and while the organs made melody  
to god alone thus in her heart sang she  
 o lord  my soul and eke my body gie 
unwemmed  lest that i confounded be   
and  for his love that died upon the tree  
every second or third day she fast   
aye bidding in her orisons full fast  
the night came  and to bedde must she gon 
with her husband  as it is the mannere  
and privily she said to him anon  
 o sweet and well beloved spouse dear  
there is a counsel  an  ye will it hear  
which that right fain i would unto you say  
so that ye swear ye will it not bewray   
valerian gan fast unto her swear 
that for no case nor thing that mighte be  
he never should to none bewrayen her  
and then at erst thus to him saide she  
 i have an angel which that loveth me  
that with great love  whether i wake or sleep  
is ready aye my body for to keep  
 and if that he may feelen  out of dread  
that ye me touch or love in villainy  
he right anon will slay you with the deed  
and in your youthe thus ye shoulde die  
and if that ye in cleane love me gie   
he will you love as me  for your cleanness  
and shew to you his joy and his brightness   
valerian  corrected as god wo ld  
answer d again   if i shall truste thee  
let me that angel see  and him behold  
and if that it a very angel be  
then will i do as thou hast prayed me  
and if thou love another man  forsooth 
right with this sword then will i slay you both   
cecile answer d anon right in this wise  
 if that you list  the angel shall ye see  
so that ye trow of christ  and you baptise  
go forth to via appia   quoth she  
that from this towne stands but miles three  
and to the poore folkes that there dwell 
say them right thus  as that i shall you tell  
 tell them  that i  cecile  you to them sent 
to shewe you the good urban the old  
for secret needes  and for good intent  
and when that ye saint urban have behold  
tell him the wordes which i to you told 
and when that he hath purged you from sin  
then shall ye see that angel ere ye twin 
valerian is to the place gone  
and  right as he was taught by her learning 
he found this holy old urban anon 
among the saintes  burials louting  
and he anon  withoute tarrying  
did his message  and when that he it told  
urban for joy his handes gan uphold  
the teares from his eyen let he fall  
 almighty lord  o jesus christ   
quoth he   sower of chaste counsel  herd of us all  
the fruit of thilke seed of chastity 
that thou hast sown in cecile  take to thee 
lo  like a busy bee  withoute guile  
thee serveth aye thine owen thrall cicile  
 for thilke spouse  that she took but now  
full like a fierce lion  she sendeth here  
as meek as e er was any lamb to owe   
and with that word anon there gan appear 
an old man  clad in white clothes clear  
that had a book with letters of gold in hand  
and gan before valerian to stand  
valerian  as dead  fell down for dread  
when he him saw  and he up hent him tho  
and on his book right thus he gan to read  
 one lord  one faith  one god withoute mo   
one christendom  one father of all also  
aboven all  and over all everywhere   
these wordes all with gold y written were  
when this was read  then said this olde man  
 believ st thou this or no  say yea or nay   
 i believe all this   quoth valerian  
 for soother thing than this  i dare well say  r 
under the heaven no wight thinke may   
then vanish d the old man  he wist not where 
and pope urban him christened right there  
valerian went home  and found cecilie 
within his chamber with an angel stand  
this angel had of roses and of lily 
corones two  the which he bare in hand  
and first to cecile  as i understand  
he gave the one  and after gan he take 
the other to valerian her make  
 with body clean  and with unwemmed thought  
keep aye well these corones two   quoth he  
 from paradise to you i have them brought  
nor ever more shall they rotten be  
nor lose their sweet savour  truste me  
nor ever wight shall see them with his eye  
but he be chaste  and hate villainy  
 and thou  valerian  for thou so soon 
assented hast to good counsel  also 
say what thee list  and thou shalt have thy boon   
 i have a brother   quoth valerian tho  
 that in this world i love no man so  
i pray you that my brother may have grace 
to know the truth  as i do in this place   
the angel said   god liketh thy request  
and bothe  with the palm of martyrdom  
ye shalle come unto this blissful rest   
and  with that word  tiburce his brother came  
and when that he the savour undernome 
which that the roses and the lilies cast  
within his heart he gan to wonder fast  
and said   i wonder  this time of the year  
whence that sweete savour cometh so 
of rose and lilies  that i smelle here  
for though i had them in mine handes two  
the savour might in me no deeper go  
the sweete smell  that in my heart i find  
hath changed me all in another kind   
valerian said   two crownes here have we  
snow white and rose red  that shine clear  
which that thine eyen have no might to see  
and  as thou smellest them through my prayere  
so shalt thou see them  leve brother dear  
if it so be thou wilt withoute sloth 
believe aright  and know the very troth   
tiburce answered   say st thou this to me 
in soothness  or in dreame hear i this   
 in dreames   quoth valorian   have we be 
unto this time  brother mine  y wis 
but now at erst in truth our dwelling is   
how know st thou this   quoth tiburce   in what wise   
quoth valerian   that shall i thee devise 
 the angel of god hath me the truth y taught  
which thou shalt see  if that thou wilt reny 
the idols  and be clean  and elles nought   
 and of the miracle of these crownes tway 
saint ambrose in his preface list to say  
solemnely this noble doctor dear 
commendeth it  and saith in this mannere 
 the palm of martyrdom for to receive  
saint cecilie  full filled of god s gift  
the world and eke her chamber gan to weive  
witness tiburce s and cecilie s shrift  
to which god of his bounty woulde shift 
corones two  of flowers well smelling  
and made his angel them the crownes bring  
 the maid hath brought these men to bliss above  
the world hath wist what it is worth  certain  
devotion of chastity to love    
then showed him cecilie all open and plain  
that idols all are but a thing in vain  
for they be dumb  and thereto they be deave  
and charged him his idols for to leave  
 whoso that troweth not this  a beast he is   
quoth this tiburce   if that i shall not lie   
and she gan kiss his breast when she heard this  
and was full glad he could the truth espy  
 this day i take thee for mine ally   
saide this blissful faire maiden dear  
and after that she said as ye may hear  
 lo  right so as the love of christ   quoth she  
 made me thy brother s wife  right in that wise 
anon for mine ally here take i thee  
since that thou wilt thine idoles despise  
go with thy brother now and thee baptise  
and make thee clean  so that thou may st behold 
the angel s face  of which thy brother told   
tiburce answer d  and saide   brother dear  
first tell me whither i shall  and to what man   
 to whom   quoth he   come forth with goode cheer  
i will thee lead unto the pope urban   
 to urban  brother mine valerian   
quoth then tiburce   wilt thou me thither lead  
me thinketh that it were a wondrous deed  
 meanest thou not that urban   quoth he tho  
 that is so often damned to be dead  
and wons in halkes always to and fro  
and dare not ones putte forth his head  
men should him brennen in a fire so red  
if he were found  or if men might him spy  
and us also  to bear him company  
 and while we seeke that divinity 
that is y hid in heaven privily  
algate burnt in this world should we be   
to whom cecilie answer d boldely  
 men mighte dreade well and skilfully 
this life to lose  mine owen deare brother  
if this were living only  and none other  
 but there is better life in other place  
that never shall be loste  dread thee nought  
which godde s son us tolde through his grace 
that father s son which alle thinges wrought  
and all that wrought is with a skilful thought  
the ghost  that from the father gan proceed  
hath souled them  withouten any drede  
 
by word and by miracle  high god s son  
when he was in this world  declared here  
that there is other life where men may won   
to whom answer d tiburce   o sister dear  
saidest thou not right now in this mannere  
there was but one god  lord in soothfastness  
and now of three how may st thou bear witness   
 that shall i tell   quoth she   ere that i go  
right as a man hath sapiences three  
memory  engine  and intellect also  
so in one being of divinity 
three persones there maye right well be   
then gan she him full busily to preach 
of christe s coming  and his paines teach  
and many pointes of his passion  
how godde s son in this world was withhold 
to do mankinde plein remission  
that was y bound in sin and cares cold  
all this thing she unto tiburce told  
and after that tiburce  in good intent  
with valerian to pope urban he went  
that thanked god  and with glad heart and light 
he christen d him  and made him in that place 
perfect in his learning  and godde s knight  
and after this tiburce got such grace  
that every day he saw in time and space 
th  angel of god  and every manner boon 
that be god asked  it was sped full anon  
it were full hard by order for to sayn 
how many wonders jesus for them wrought  
but at the last  to telle short and plain  
the sergeants of the town of rome them sought  
and them before almach the prefect brought  
which them apposed  and knew all their intent  
and to th image of jupiter them sent  
and said   whoso will not do sacrifice  
swap off his head  this is my sentence here   
anon these martyrs  i you devise  
one maximus  that was an officere 
of the prefect s  and his corniculere 
them hent  and when he forth the saintes lad  
himself he wept for pity that he had  
when maximus had heard the saintes lore  
he got him of the tormentores leave  
and led them to his house withoute more  
and with their preaching  ere that it were eve  
they gonnen from the tormentors to reave  
and from maxim   and from his folk each one  
the false faith  to trow in god alone  
cecilia came  when it was waxen night  
with priestes  that them christen d  
and afterward  when day was waxen light  
cecile them said with a full steadfast cheer  
 now  christe s owen knightes lefe and dear  
cast all away the workes of darkness  
and arme you in armour of brightness  
ye have forsooth y done a great battaile  
your course is done  your faith have ye conserved  
o to the crown of life that may not fail  
the rightful judge  which that ye have served 
shall give it you  as ye have it deserved   
and when this thing was said  as i devise  relate 
men led them forth to do the sacrifice  
but when they were unto the place brought 
to telle shortly the conclusion  
they would incense nor sacrifice right nought 
but on their knees they sette them adown  
with humble heart and sad devotion  
and loste both their heades in the place  
their soules wente to the king of grace  
this maximus  that saw this thing betide  
with piteous teares told it anon right  
that he their soules saw to heaven glide 
with angels  full of clearness and of light 
andt with his word converted many a wight  
for which almachius did him to beat 
with whip of lead  till he his life gan lete  
cecile him took  and buried him anon 
by tiburce and valerian softely  
within their burying place  under the stone  
and after this almachius hastily 
bade his ministers fetchen openly 
cecile  so that she might in his presence 
do sacrifice  and jupiter incense  
but they  converted at her wise lore  
wepte full sore  and gave full credence 
unto her word  and cried more and more  
 christ  godde s son  withoute difference  
is very god  this is all our sentence 
that hath so good a servant him to serve 
thus with one voice we trowe  though we sterve  
almachius  that heard of this doing  
bade fetch cecilie  that he might her see  
and alderfirst  lo  this was his asking  
 what manner woman arte thou   quoth he  
 i am a gentle woman born   quoth she  
 i aske thee   quoth he  though it thee grieve  
of thy religion and of thy believe   
 ye have begun your question foolishly   
quoth she   that wouldest two answers conclude 
in one demand  ye aske lewedly   ly 
almach answer d to that similitude  
 of whence comes thine answering so rude   
 of whence   quoth she  when that she was freined  
 of conscience  and of good faith unfeigned   
almachius saide   takest thou no heed 
of my power   and she him answer d this  
 your might   quoth she   full little is to dread  
for every mortal manne s power is 
but like a bladder full of wind  y wis  
for with a needle s point  when it is blow   
may all the boast of it be laid full low   
 full wrongfully begunnest thou   quoth he  
 and yet in wrong is thy perseverance  
know st thou not how our mighty princes free 
have thus commanded and made ordinance  
that every christian wight shall have penance  
but if that he his christendom withsay  
and go all quit  if he will it renay   
 your princes erren  as your nobley doth   
quoth then cecile   and with a wood sentence 
ye make us guilty  and it is not sooth  
for ye that knowe well our innocence  
forasmuch as we do aye reverence 
to christ  and for we bear a christian name  
ye put on us a crime and eke a blame  
 but we that knowe thilke name so 
for virtuous  we may it not withsay   
almach answered   choose one of these two  
do sacrifice  or christendom renay  
that thou may st now escape by that way   
at which the holy blissful faire maid 
gan for to laugh  and to the judge said  
 o judge  confused in thy nicety  
wouldest thou that i reny innocence  
to make me a wicked wight   quoth she  
 lo  he dissimuleth here in audience  
he stareth and woodeth in his advertence   
to whom almachius said   unsely wretch  
knowest thou not how far my might may stretch  
 have not our mighty princes to me given 
yea bothe power and eke authority 
to make folk to dien or to liven  
why speakest thou so proudly then to me   
 i speake not but steadfastly   quoth she  
not proudly  for i say  as for my side  
we hate deadly thilke vice of pride  
 and  if thou dreade not a sooth to hear  
then will i shew all openly by right  
that thou hast made a full great leasing here  
thou say st thy princes have thee given might 
both for to slay and for to quick a wight    
thou that may st not but only life bereave  
thou hast none other power nor no leave  
 but thou may st say  thy princes have thee maked 
minister of death  for if thou speak of mo   
thou liest  for thy power is full naked   
 do away thy boldness   said almachius tho  
 and sacrifice to our gods  ere thou go  
i recke not what wrong that thou me proffer  
for i can suffer it as a philosopher  
 but those wronges may i not endure  
that thou speak st of our goddes here   quoth he  
cecile answer d   o nice creature  
thou saidest no word  since thou spake to me  
that i knew not therewith thy nicety  
and that thou wert in every manner wise 
a lewed officer  a vain justice  
 there lacketh nothing to thine outward eyen 
that thou art blind  for thing that we see all 
that it is stone  that men may well espyen  
that ilke stone a god thou wilt it call  
i rede thee let thine hand upon it fall  
and taste it well  and stone thou shalt it find  
since that thou see st not with thine eyen blind  
 it is a shame that the people shall 
so scorne thee  and laugh at thy folly  
for commonly men wot it well over all  
that mighty god is in his heaven high  
and these images  well may st thou espy  
to thee nor to themselves may not profite  
for in effect they be not worth a mite   
these wordes and such others saide she  
and he wax d wroth  and bade men should her lead 
home to her house   and in her house   quoth he  
 burn her right in a bath  with flames red   
and as he bade  right so was done the deed  
for in a bath they gan her faste shetten  
and night and day great fire they under betten  
the longe night  and eke a day also  
for all the fire  and eke the bathe s heat  
she sat all cold  and felt of it no woe  
it made her not one droppe for to sweat  
but in that bath her life she must lete  
for he  almachius  with full wick  intent  
to slay her in the bath his sonde sent  
three strokes in the neck he smote her tho  
the tormentor  but for no manner chance 
he might not smite her faire neck in two  
and  for there was that time an ordinance 
that no man should do man such penance  
the fourthe stroke to smite  soft or sore  
this tormentor he durste do no more  
but half dead  with her necke carven there 
he let her lie  and on his way is went  
the christian folk  which that about her were  
with sheetes have the blood full fair y hent  
three dayes lived she in this torment  
and never ceased them the faith to teach  
that she had foster d them  she gan to preach  
and them she gave her mebles and her thing  ods 
and to the pope urban betook them tho  
and said   i aske this of heaven s king  
to have respite three dayes and no mo   
to recommend to you  ere that i go  
these soules  lo  and that i might do wirch 
here of mine house perpetually a church   
saint urban  with his deacons  privily 
the body fetch d  and buried it by night 
among his other saintes honestly  
her house the church of saint cecilie hight  
saint urban hallow d it  as he well might  
in which unto this day  in noble wise  
men do to christ and to his saint service  
 
the canon s yeoman s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
when ended was the life of saint cecile  
ere we had ridden fully five mile  
at boughton under blee us gan o ertake 
a man  that clothed was in clothes black  
and underneath he wore a white surplice  
his hackenay  which was all pomely gris  
so sweated  that it wonder was to see  
it seem d as he had pricked miles three  
the horse eke that his yeoman rode upon 
so sweated  that unnethes might he gon  
about the peytrel stood the foam full high  
he was of foam  as flecked as a pie  
a maile twyfold on his crupper lay  
it seemed that he carried little array  
all light for summer rode this worthy man  
and in my heart to wonder i began 
what that he was  till that i understood 
how that his cloak was sewed to his hood  
for which  when i had long advised me  
i deemed him some canon for to be  
his hat hung at his back down by a lace  
for he had ridden more than trot or pace  
he hadde pricked like as he were wood 
a clote leaf he had laid under his hood  
for sweat  and for to keep his head from heat  
but it was joye for to see him sweat  
his forehead dropped as a stillatory 
were full of plantain or of paritory  
and when that he was come  he gan to cry  
 god save   quoth he   this jolly company  
fast have i pricked   quoth he   for your sake  
because that i would you overtake  
to riden in this merry company   
his yeoman was eke full of courtesy  
and saide   sirs  now in the morning tide 
out of your hostelry i saw you ride  
and warned here my lord and sovereign  
which that to ride with you is full fain  
for his disport  he loveth dalliance   
 friend  for thy warning god give thee good chance   
said oure host   certain it woulde seem 
thy lord were wise  and so i may well deem  
he is full jocund also  dare i lay  
can he aught tell a merry tale or tway  
with which he gladden may this company   
 who  sir  my lord  yea  sir  withoute lie  
he can of mirth and eke of jollity 
not but enough  also  sir  truste me  
an ye him knew all so well as do i  
ye would wonder how well and craftily 
he coulde work  and that in sundry wise  
he hath take on him many a great emprise  
which were full hard for any that is here 
to bring about  but they of him it lear  
as homely as he rides amonges you  
if ye him knew  it would be for your prow  
ye woulde not forego his acquaintance 
for muche good  i dare lay in balance 
all that i have in my possession  
he is a man of high discretion  
i warn you well  he is a passing man   
well   quoth our host   i pray thee tell me than  
is he a clerk  or no  tell what he is   
 nay  he is greater than a clerk  y wis   
saide this yeoman   and  in wordes few  
host  of his craft somewhat i will you shew  
i say  my lord can such a subtlety 
but all his craft ye may not weet of me  
and somewhat help i yet to his working  
that all the ground on which we be riding 
till that we come to canterbury town  
he could all cleane turnen up so down  
and pave it all of silver and of gold   
and when this yeoman had this tale told 
unto our host  he said   ben dicite  
this thing is wonder marvellous to me  
since that thy lord is of so high prudence  
because of which men should him reverence  
that of his worship recketh he so lite  
his overest slop it is not worth a mite 
as in effect to him  so may i go  
it is all baudy and to tore also  
why is thy lord so sluttish  i thee pray  
and is of power better clothes to bey  
if that his deed accordeth with thy speech  
telle me that  and that i thee beseech   
 why   quoth this yeoman   whereto ask ye me  
god help me so  for he shall never the 
but i will not avowe that i say  
and therefore keep it secret  i you pray  
he is too wise  in faith  as i believe  
thing that is overdone  it will not preve 
aright  as clerkes say  it is a vice  
wherefore in that i hold him lewd and nice   
for when a man hath over great a wit  
full oft him happens to misusen it  
so doth my lord  and that me grieveth sore  
god it amend  i can say now no more   
 thereof no force  good yeoman   quoth our host  
 since of the conning of thy lord  thou know st  
tell how he doth  i pray thee heartily  
since that be is so crafty and so sly  
where dwelle ye  if it to telle be   
 in the suburbes of a town   quoth he  
 lurking in hernes and in lanes blind  
where as these robbers and these thieves by kind 
holde their privy fearful residence  
as they that dare not show their presence  
so fare we  if i shall say the soothe   
 yet   quoth our hoste   let me talke to thee  
why art thou so discolour d of thy face   
 peter   quoth he   god give it harde grace  
i am so us d the hote fire to blow  
that it hath changed my colour  i trow  
i am not wont in no mirror to pry  
but swinke sore  and learn to multiply  
we blunder ever  and poren in the fire  
and  for all that  we fail of our desire 
for ever we lack our conclusion 
to muche folk we do illusion  
and borrow gold  be it a pound or two  
or ten or twelve  or many summes mo   
and make them weenen  at the leaste way  
that of a pounde we can make tway  
yet is it false  and aye we have good hope 
it for to do  and after it we grope  
but that science is so far us beforn  
that we may not  although we had it sworn  
it overtake  it slides away so fast  
it will us make beggars at the last   
while this yeoman was thus in his talking  
this canon drew him near  and heard all thing 
which this yeoman spake  for suspicion 
of menne s speech ever had this canon  
for cato saith  that he that guilty is  
deemeth all things be spoken of him y wis  
because of that he gan so nigh to draw 
to his yeoman  that he heard all his saw  
and thus he said unto his yeoman tho 
 hold thou thy peace and speak no wordes mo   
for if thou do  thou shalt it dear abie  
thou slanderest me here in this company 
and eke discoverest that thou shouldest hide   
 yea   quoth our host   tell on  whatso betide  
of all his threatening reck not a mite   
 in faith   quoth he   no more do i but lite   
and when this canon saw it would not be 
but his yeoman would tell his privity  
he fled away for very sorrow and shame  
 ah   quoth the yeoman   here shall rise a game  
all that i can anon i will you tell  
since he is gone  the foule fiend him quell  
for ne er hereafter will i with him meet  
for penny nor for pound  i you behete  
he that me broughte first unto that game  
ere that he die  sorrow have he and shame  
for it is earnest to me  by my faith  
that feel i well  what so any man saith  
and yet for all my smart  and all my grief  
for all my sorrow  labour  and mischief  
i coulde never leave it in no wise  
now would to god my witte might suffice 
to tellen all that longeth to that art  
but natheless yet will i telle part  
since that my lord is gone  i will not spare  
such thing as that i know  i will declare   
 
the tale  
 
with this canon i dwelt have seven year  
and of his science am i ne er the near 
all that i had i have lost thereby  
and  god wot  so have many more than i  
where i was wont to be right fresh and gay 
of clothing  and of other good array 
now may i wear an hose upon mine head  
and where my colour was both fresh and red  
now is it wan  and of a leaden hue 
whoso it useth  sore shall he it rue  
and of my swink yet bleared is mine eye  
lo what advantage is to multiply  
that sliding science hath me made so bare  
that i have no good  where that ever i fare  
and yet i am indebted so thereby 
of gold  that i have borrow d truely  
that  while i live  i shall it quite never  
let every man beware by me for ever  
what manner man that casteth him thereto  
if he continue  i hold his thrift y do  
so help me god  thereby shall he not win  
but empty his purse  and make his wittes thin  
and when he  through his madness and folly  
hath lost his owen good through jupartie  
then he exciteth other men thereto  
to lose their good as he himself hath do   
for unto shrewes joy it is and ease 
to have their fellows in pain and disease  
thus was i ones learned of a clerk  
of that no charge  i will speak of our work  
when we be there as we shall exercise 
our elvish craft  we seeme wonder wise  
our termes be so clergial and quaint  
i blow the fire till that mine hearte faint  
why should i tellen each proportion 
of thinges  whiche that we work upon  
as on five or six ounces  may well be  
of silver  or some other quantity  
and busy me to telle you the names  
as orpiment  burnt bones  iron squames  
that into powder grounden be full small  
and in an earthen pot how put is all  
and  salt y put in  and also peppere  
before these powders that i speak of here  
and well y cover d with a lamp of glass  
and of much other thing which that there was  
and of the pots and glasses engluting  
that of the air might passen out no thing  
and of the easy fire  and smart also  
which that was made  and of the care and woe 
that we had in our matters subliming  
and in amalgaming  and calcining 
of quicksilver  called mercury crude  
for all our sleightes we can not conclude  
our orpiment  and sublim d mercury  
our ground litharge eke on the porphyry  
of each of these of ounces a certain  
not helpeth us  our labour is in vain  
nor neither our spirits  ascensioun  
nor our matters that lie all fix d adown  
may in our working nothing us avail  
for lost is all our labour and travail  
and all the cost  a twenty devil way  
is lost also  which we upon it lay  
there is also full many another thing 
that is unto our craft appertaining  
though i by order them not rehearse can  
because that i am a lewed man  
yet will i tell them as they come to mind  
although i cannot set them in their kind  
as sal armoniac  verdigris  borace  
and sundry vessels made of earth and glass  
our urinales  and our descensories  
phials  and croslets  and sublimatories  
cucurbites  and alembikes eke  
and other suche  enough a leek  
it needeth not for to rehearse them all  
waters rubifying  and bulles  gall  
arsenic  sal armoniac  and brimstone  
and herbes could i tell eke many a one  
as egremoine  valerian  and lunary  
and other such  if that me list to tarry  
our lampes burning bothe night and day  
to bring about our craft if that we may  
our furnace eke of calcination  
and of waters albification  
unslaked lime  chalk  and glair of an ey  
powders diverse  ashes  dung  piss  and clay  
seared pokettes  saltpetre  and vitriol  
and divers fires made of wood and coal  
sal tartar  alkali  salt preparate  
and combust matters  and coagulate  
clay made with horse and manne s hair  and oil 
of tartar  alum  glass  barm  wort  argoil  
rosalgar  and other matters imbibing  
and eke of our matters encorporing  
and of our silver citrination  
our cementing  and fermentation  
our ingots  tests  and many thinges mo   
i will you tell  as was me taught also  
the foure spirits  and the bodies seven  
by order  as oft i heard my lord them neven  
the first spirit quicksilver called is  
the second orpiment  the third  y wis  
sal armoniac  and the fourth brimstone  
the bodies sev n eke  lo them here anon  
sol gold is  and luna silver we threpe 
mars iron  mercury quicksilver we clepe  
saturnus lead  and jupiter is tin  
and venus copper  by my father s kin  
this cursed craft whoso will exercise  
he shall no good have that him may suffice  
for all the good he spendeth thereabout  
he lose shall  thereof have i no doubt  
whoso that list to utter his folly  
let him come forth and learn to multiply  
and every man that hath aught in his coffer  
let him appear  and wax a philosopher  
ascaunce that craft is so light to lear  
nay  nay  god wot  all be he monk or frere  
priest or canon  or any other wight  
though he sit at his book both day and night  
in learning of this elvish nice lore  
all is in vain  and pardie muche more  
is to learn a lew d man this subtlety  
fie  speak not thereof  for it will not be  
and conne he letterure  or conne he none  
as in effect  he shall it find all one  
for bothe two  by my salvation  
concluden in multiplication 
alike well  when they have all y do  
this is to say  they faile bothe two  
yet forgot i to make rehearsale 
of waters corrosive  and of limaile  
and of bodies  mollification  
and also of their induration  
oiles  ablutions  metal fusible  
to tellen all  would passen any bible 
that owhere is  wherefore  as for the best  
of all these names now will i me rest  
for  as i trow  i have you told enough 
to raise a fiend  all look he ne er so rough  
ah  nay  let be  the philosopher s stone  
elixir call d  we seeke fast each one  
for had we him  then were we sicker enow  
but unto god of heaven i make avow  
for all our craft  when we have all y do  
and all our sleight  he will not come us to  
he hath y made us spende muche good  
for sorrow of which almost we waxed wood  
but that good hope creeped in our heart  
supposing ever  though we sore smart  
to be relieved by him afterward  
such supposing and hope is sharp and hard  
i warn you well it is to seeken ever  
that future temps hath made men dissever  
in trust thereof  from all that ever they had  
yet of that art they cannot waxe sad  
for unto them it is a bitter sweet  
so seemeth it  for had they but a sheet 
which that they mighte wrap them in at night  
and a bratt to walk in by dayelight  
they would them sell  and spend it on this craft  
they cannot stint  until no thing be laft  
and evermore  wherever that they gon  
men may them knowe by smell of brimstone  
for all the world they stinken as a goat  
their savour is so rammish and so hot  
that though a man a mile from them be  
the savour will infect him  truste me  
lo  thus by smelling and threadbare array  
if that men list  this folk they knowe may  
and if a man will ask them privily  
why they be clothed so unthriftily  
they right anon will rownen in his ear  
and sayen  if that they espied were  
men would them slay  because of their science  
lo  thus these folk betrayen innocence  
pass over this  i go my tale unto  
ere that the pot be on the fire y do 
of metals  with a certain quantity 
my lord them tempers  and no man but he 
now he is gone  i dare say boldely  
for as men say  he can do craftily  
algate i wot well he hath such a name  
and yet full oft he runneth into blame  
and know ye how  full oft it happ neth so  
the pot to breaks  and farewell  all is go   
these metals be of so great violence  
our walles may not make them resistence  
but if they were wrought of lime and stone  
they pierce so  that through the wall they gon  
and some of them sink down into the ground 
thus have we lost by times many a pound  
and some are scatter d all the floor about  
some leap into the roof withoute doubt  
though that the fiend not in our sight him show  
i trowe that he be with us  that shrew  
in helle  where that he is lord and sire  
is there no more woe  rancour  nor ire  
when that our pot is broke  as i have said  
every man chides  and holds him apaid  
some said it was on the fire making  
some saide nay  it was on the blowing 
then was i fear d  for that was mine office  
 straw   quoth the third   ye be lewed and nice  
it was not temper d as it ought to be   
 nay   quoth the fourthe   stint and hearken me  
because our fire was not y made of beech  
that is the cause  and other none  so the ch  
i cannot tell whereon it was along  
but well i wot great strife is us among   
 what   quoth my lord   there is no more to do n  
of these perils i will beware eftsoon  
i am right sicker that the pot was crazed  
be as be may  be ye no thing amazed  
as usage is  let sweep the floor as swithe  
pluck up your heartes and be glad and blithe   
the mullok on a heap y sweeped was  
and on the floor y cast a canevas  
and all this mullok in a sieve y throw  
and sifted  and y picked many a throw  
 pardie   quoth one   somewhat of our metal 
yet is there here  though that we have not all  
and though this thing mishapped hath as now  
another time it may be well enow  
we muste put our good in adventure  
a merchant  pardie  may not aye endure  
truste me well  in his prosperity  
sometimes his good is drenched in the sea  
and sometimes comes it safe unto the land   
 peace   quoth my lord   the next time i will fand 
to bring our craft all in another plight  
and but i do  sirs  let me have the wite  
there was default in somewhat  well i wot   
another said  the fire was over hot  
but be it hot or cold  i dare say this  
that we concluden evermore amiss  
we fail alway of that which we would have  
and in our madness evermore we rave  
and when we be together every one  
every man seemeth a solomon  
but all thing  which that shineth as the gold  
it is not gold  as i have heard it told  
nor every apple that is fair at eye  
it is not good  what so men clap or cry  
right so  lo  fareth it amonges us  
he that the wisest seemeth  by jesus  
is most fool  when it cometh to the prefe  
and he that seemeth truest  is a thief  
that shall ye know  ere that i from you wend  
by that i of my tale have made an end  
there was a canon of religioun 
amonges us  would infect all a town  
though it as great were as was nineveh  
rome  alisandre  troy  or other three  
his sleightes and his infinite falseness 
there coulde no man writen  as i guess  
though that he mighte live a thousand year  
in all this world of falseness n is his peer  
for in his termes he will him so wind  
and speak his wordes in so sly a kind  
when he commune shall with any wight  
that he will make him doat anon aright  
but it a fiende be  as himself is  
full many a man hath he beguil d ere this  
and will  if that he may live any while  
and yet men go and ride many a mile 
him for to seek  and have his acquaintance  
not knowing of his false governance  
and if you list to give me audience  
i will it telle here in your presence  
but  worshipful canons religious  
ne deeme not that i slander your house  
although that my tale of a canon be  
of every order some shrew is  pardie  
and god forbid that all a company 
should rue a singular manne s folly  
to slander you is no thing mine intent  
but to correct that is amiss i meant  
this tale was not only told for you  
but eke for other more  ye wot well how 
that amonges christe s apostles twelve 
there was no traitor but judas himselve  
then why should all the remenant have blame  
that guiltless were  by you i say the same  
save only this  if ye will hearken me  
if any judas in your convent be  
remove him betimes  i you rede  
if shame or loss may causen any dread  
and be no thing displeased  i you pray  
but in this case hearken what i say  
in london was a priest  an annualere  
that therein dwelled hadde many a year  
which was so pleasant and so serviceable 
unto the wife  where as he was at table  
that she would suffer him no thing to pay 
for board nor clothing  went he ne er so gay  
and spending silver had he right enow  
thereof no force  will proceed as now  
and telle forth my tale of the canon  
that brought this prieste to confusion  
this false canon came upon a day 
unto the prieste s chamber  where he lay  
beseeching him to lend him a certain 
of gold  and he would quit it him again  
 lend me a mark   quoth he   but dayes three  
and at my day i will it quite thee  
and if it so be that thou find me false  
another day hang me up by the halse   
this priest him took a mark  and that as swithe  
and this canon him thanked often sithe  
and took his leave  and wente forth his way  
and at the thirde day brought his money  
and to the priest he took his gold again  
whereof this priest was wondrous glad and fain  
 certes   quoth he   nothing annoyeth me 
to lend a man a noble  or two  or three  
or what thing were in my possession  
when he so true is of condition  
that in no wise he breake will his day  
to such a man i never can say nay   
 what   quoth this canon   should i be untrue  
nay  that were thing y fallen all of new  
truth is a thing that i will ever keep  
unto the day in which that i shall creep 
into my grave  and elles god forbid  
believe this as sicker as your creed  
god thank i  and in good time be it said  
that there was never man yet apaid 
for gold nor silver that he to me lent  
nor ever falsehood in mine heart i meant  
and sir   quoth he   now of my privity  
since ye so goodly have been unto me  
and kithed to me so great gentleness  
somewhat  to quite with your kindeness  
i will you shew  and if you list to lear  
i will you teache plainly the mannere 
how i can worken in philosophy  
take good heed  ye shall well see at eye 
that i will do a mas try ere i go   
 yea   quoth the priest   yea  sir  and will ye so  
mary  thereof i pray you heartily   
 at your commandement  sir  truely   
quoth the canon   and elles god forbid   
lo  how this thiefe could his service bede  
full sooth it is that such proffer d service 
stinketh  as witnesse these olde wise  
and that full soon i will it verify 
in this canon  root of all treachery  
that evermore delight had and gladness 
such fiendly thoughtes in his heart impress 
how christe s people he may to mischief bring  
god keep us from his false dissimuling  
what wiste this priest with whom that he dealt  
nor of his harm coming he nothing felt  
o sely priest  o sely innocent  
with covetise anon thou shalt be blent  
o graceless  full blind is thy conceit  
for nothing art thou ware of the deceit 
which that this fox y shapen hath to thee  
his wily wrenches thou not mayest flee  
wherefore  to go to the conclusioun 
that referreth to thy confusion  
unhappy man  anon i will me hie 
to telle thine unwit and thy folly  stupidity 
and eke the falseness of that other wretch  
as farforth as that my conning will stretch  
this canon was my lord  ye woulde ween  
sir host  in faith  and by the heaven s queen  
it was another canon  and not he  
that can an hundred fold more subtlety  
he hath betrayed folkes many a time  
of his falseness it doleth me to rhyme  
and ever  when i speak of his falsehead  
for shame of him my cheekes waxe red  
algates they beginne for to glow  at least 
for redness have i none  right well i know  
in my visage  for fumes diverse 
of metals  which ye have me heard rehearse  
consumed have and wasted my redness  
now take heed of this canon s cursedness  
 sir   quoth he to the priest   let your man gon 
for quicksilver  that we it had anon  
and let him bringen ounces two or three  
and when he comes  as faste shall ye see 
a wondrous thing  which ye saw ne er ere this   
 sir   quoth the priest   it shall be done  y wis   
he bade his servant fetche him this thing  
and he all ready was at his bidding  
and went him forth  and came anon again 
with this quicksilver  shortly for to sayn  
and took these ounces three to the canoun  
and he them laide well and fair adown  
and bade the servant coales for to bring  
that he anon might go to his working  
the coales right anon weren y fet  
and this canon y took a crosselet 
out of his bosom  and shew d to the priest  
 this instrument   quoth he   which that thou seest  
take in thine hand  and put thyself therein 
of this quicksilver an ounce  and here begin  
in the name of christ  to wax a philosopher  
there be full few  which that i woulde proffer 
to shewe them thus much of my science  
for here shall ye see by experience 
that this quicksilver i will mortify  
right in your sight anon withoute lie  
and make it as good silver  and as fine  
as there is any in your purse  or mine  
or elleswhere  and make it malleable  
and elles holde me false and unable 
amonge folk for ever to appear  
i have a powder here that cost me dear  
shall make all good  for it is cause of all 
my conning  which that i you shewe shall  
voide your man  and let him be thereout  
and shut the doore  while we be about 
our privity  that no man us espy  
while that we work in this phiosophy   
all  as he bade  fulfilled was in deed  
this ilke servant right anon out yede  
and his master y shut the door anon  
and to their labour speedily they gon  
this priest  at this cursed canon s bidding  
upon the fire anon he set this thing  
and blew the fire  and busied him full fast  
and this canon into the croslet cast 
a powder  i know not whereof it was 
y made  either of chalk  either of glass  
or somewhat elles  was not worth a fly  
to blinden with this priest  and bade him hie 
the coales for to couchen all above lay in order 
the croslet   for  in token i thee love   
quoth this canon   thine owen handes two 
shall work all thing that here shall be do    
 grand mercy   quoth the priest  and was full glad  
and couch d the coales as the canon bade  
and while he busy was  this fiendly wretch  
this false canon the foule fiend him fetch  
out of his bosom took a beechen coal  
in which full subtifly was made a hole  
and therein put was of silver limaile 
an ounce  and stopped was withoute fail 
the hole with wax  to keep the limaile in  
and understande  that this false gin 
was not made there  but it was made before  
and other thinges i shall tell you more  
hereafterward  which that he with him brought  
ere he came there  him to beguile he thought  
and so he did  ere that they went atwin  
till he had turned him  could he not blin  
it doleth me  when that i of him speak  
on his falsehood fain would i me awreak  
if i wist how  but he is here and there  
he is so variant  he abides nowhere  
but take heed  sirs  now for godde s love  
he took his coal  of which i spake above  
and in his hand he bare it privily  
and while the prieste couched busily 
the coales  as i tolde you ere this  
this canon saide   friend  ye do amiss  
this is not couched as it ought to be  
but soon i shall amenden it   quoth he  
 now let me meddle therewith but a while  
for of you have i pity  by saint gile  
ye be right hot  i see well how ye sweat  
have here a cloth  and wipe away the wet   
and while that the prieste wip d his face  
this canon took his coal    with sorry grace    
and layed it above on the midward attend him  
of the croslet  and blew well afterward  
till that the coals beganne fast to brenn  
 now give us drinke   quoth this canon then  
 and swithe all shall be well  i undertake  
sitte we down  and let us merry make   
and whenne that this canon s beechen coal 
was burnt  all the limaile out of the hole 
into the crosselet anon fell down  
and so it muste needes  by reasoun  
since it above so even couched was  
but thereof wist the priest no thing  alas  
he deemed all the coals alike good  
for of the sleight he nothing understood  
and when this alchemister saw his time  
 rise up  sir priest   quoth he   and stand by me  
and  for i wot well ingot have ye none  
go  walke forth  and bring me a chalk stone  
for i will make it of the same shape 
that is an ingot  if i may have hap  
bring eke with you a bowl  or else a pan  
full of water  and ye shall well see than 
how that our business shall hap and preve 
and yet  for ye shall have no misbelieve 
nor wrong conceit of me  in your absence  
i wille not be out of your presence  
but go with you  and come with you again   
the chamber doore  shortly for to sayn  
they opened and shut  and went their way  
and forth with them they carried the key  
and came again without any delay  
why should i tarry all the longe day  
he took the chalk  and shap d it in the wise 
of an ingot  as i shall you devise  
i say  he took out of his owen sleeve 
a teine of silver evil may he cheve  
which that ne was but a just ounce of weight  
and take heed now of his cursed sleight  
he shap d his ingot  in length and in brede 
of this teine  withouten any drede  
so slily  that the priest it not espied  
and in his sleeve again he gan it hide  
and from the fire he took up his mattere  
and in th  ingot put it with merry cheer  
and in the water vessel he it cast  
when that him list  and bade the priest as fast 
look what there is   put in thine hand and grope  
there shalt thou finde silver  as i hope   
what  devil of helle  should it elles be  
shaving of silver  silver is  pardie  
he put his hand in  and took up a teine 
of silver fine  and glad in every vein 
was this priest  when he saw that it was so  
 godde s blessing  and his mother s also  
and alle hallows  have ye  sir canon   
saide this priest   and i their malison 
but  an  ye vouchesafe to teache me 
this noble craft and this subtility  
i will be yours in all that ever i may   
quoth the canon   yet will i make assay 
the second time  that ye may take heed  
and be expert of this  and  in your need  
another day assay in mine absence 
this discipline  and this crafty science  
let take another ounce   quoth he tho  
 of quicksilver  withoute wordes mo   
and do therewith as ye have done ere this 
with that other  which that now silver is   
the priest him busied  all that e er he can  
to do as this canon  this cursed man  
commanded him  and fast he blew the fire 
for to come to th  effect of his desire  
and this canon right in the meanewhile 
all ready was this priest eft to beguile  
and  for a countenance  in his hande bare 
an hollow sticke take keep and beware  
of silver limaile put was  as before 
was in his coal  and stopped with wax well 
for to keep in his limaile every deal  
and while this priest was in his business  
this canon with his sticke gan him dress 
to him anon  and his powder cast in  
as he did erst the devil out of his skin 
him turn  i pray to god  for his falsehead  
for he was ever false in thought and deed  
and with his stick  above the crosselet  
that was ordained with that false get  
he stirr d the coales  till relente gan 
the wax against the fire  as every man  
but he a fool be  knows well it must need  
and all that in the sticke was out yede  
and in the croslet hastily it fell  
now  goode sirs  what will ye bet than well  
when that this priest was thus beguil d again  
supposing naught but truthe  sooth to sayn  
he was so glad  that i can not express 
in no mannere his mirth and his gladness  
and to the canon he proffer d eftsoon 
body and good   yea   quoth the canon soon  
 though poor i be  crafty thou shalt me find  
i warn thee well  yet is there more behind  
is any copper here within   said he  
 yea  sir   the prieste said   i trow there be   
 elles go buy us some  and that as swithe  
now  goode sir  go forth thy way and hie thee   
he went his way  and with the copper came  
and this canon it in his handes name  
and of that copper weighed out an ounce  
too simple is my tongue to pronounce  
as minister of my wit  the doubleness 
of this canon  root of all cursedness  
he friendly seem d to them that knew him not  
but he was fiendly  both in work and thought  
it wearieth me to tell of his falseness  
and natheless yet will i it express  
to that intent men may beware thereby  
and for none other cause truely  
he put this copper in the crosselet  
and on the fire as swithe he hath it set  
and cast in powder  and made the priest to blow  
and in his working for to stoope low  
as he did erst  and all was but a jape  
right as him list the priest he made his ape  
and afterward in the ingot he it cast  
and in the pan he put it at the last 
of water  and in he put his own hand  
and in his sleeve  as ye beforehand 
hearde me tell  he had a silver teine  
he silly took it out  this cursed heine 
unweeting this priest of his false craft  
and in the panne s bottom he it laft 
and in the water rumbleth to and fro  
and wondrous privily took up also 
the copper teine not knowing thilke priest  
and hid it  and him hente by the breast  
and to him spake  and thus said in his game  
 stoop now adown  by god  ye be to blame  
helpe me now  as i did you whilere  
put in your hand  and looke what is there   
this priest took up this silver teine anon  
and thenne said the canon   let us gon  
with these three teines which that we have wrought  
to some goldsmith  and weet if they be aught  
for  by my faith  i would not for my hood worth anything 
but if they were silver fine and good  
and that as swithe well proved shall it be   
unto the goldsmith with these teines three 
they went anon  and put them in assay 
to fire and hammer  might no man say nay  
but that they weren as they ought to be  
this sotted priest  who gladder was than he  
was never bird gladder against the day  
nor nightingale in the season of may 
was never none  that better list to sing  
nor lady lustier in carolling  
or for to speak of love and womanhead  
nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed  
to standen in grace of his lady dear  
than had this priest this crafte for to lear  
and to the canon thus he spake and said  
 for love of god  that for us alle died  
and as i may deserve it unto you  
what shall this receipt coste  tell me now   
 by our lady   quoth this canon   it is dear  
i warn you well  that  save i and a frere  
in engleland there can no man it make   
 no force   quoth he   now  sir  for godde s sake  
what shall i pay  telle me  i you pray   
 y wis   quoth he   it is full dear  i say  
sir  at one word  if that you list it have  
ye shall pay forty pound  so god me save  
and n ere the friendship that ye did ere this 
to me  ye shoulde paye more  y wis   
this priest the sum of forty pound anon 
of nobles fet  and took them every one 
to this canon  for this ilke receipt  
all his working was but fraud and deceit  
 sir priest   he said   i keep to have no los 
of my craft  for i would it were kept close  
and as ye love me  keep it secre  
for if men knewen all my subtlety  
by god  they woulde have so great envy 
to me  because of my philosophy  
i should be dead  there were no other way   
 god it forbid   quoth the priest   what ye say  
yet had i lever spenden all the good 
which that i have and elles were i wood  
than that ye shoulde fall in such mischief   
 for your good will  sir  have ye right good prefe   
quoth the canon   and farewell  grand mercy   
he went his way  and never the priest him sey 
after that day  and when that this priest should 
maken assay  at such time as he would  
of this receipt  farewell  it would not be  
lo  thus bejaped and beguil d was he  
thus made he his introduction 
to bringe folk to their destruction  
consider  sirs  how that in each estate 
betwixte men and gold there is debate  
so farforth that unnethes is there none  
this multiplying blint so many a one  
that in good faith i trowe that it be 
the cause greatest of such scarcity  
these philosophers speak so mistily 
in this craft  that men cannot come thereby  
for any wit that men have how a days  
they may well chatter  as do these jays  
and in their termes set their lust and pain  
but to their purpose shall they ne er attain  
a man may lightly learn  if he have aught  
to multiply  and bring his good to naught  
lo  such a lucre is in this lusty game  
a manne s mirth it will turn all to grame  
and empty also great and heavy purses  
and make folke for to purchase curses 
of them that have thereto their good y lent  
oh  fy for shame  they that have been brent  
alas  can they not flee the fire s heat  
ye that it use  i rede that ye it lete  
lest ye lose all  for better than never is late  
never to thrive  were too long a date  
though ye prowl aye  ye shall it never find  
ye be as bold as is bayard the blind  
that blunders forth  and peril casteth none  
he is as bold to run against a stone  
as for to go beside it in the way  
so fare ye that multiply  i say  
if that your eyen cannot see aright  
look that your minde lacke not his sight  
for though you look never so broad  and stare  
ye shall not win a mite on that chaffare  
but wasten all that ye may rape and renn  
withdraw the fire  lest it too faste brenn  
meddle no more with that art  i mean  
for if ye do  your thrift is gone full clean  
and right as swithe i will you telle here 
what philosophers say in this mattere  
lo  thus saith arnold of the newe town  
as his rosary maketh mentioun  
he saith right thus  withouten any lie  
 there may no man mercury mortify  
but it be with his brother s knowledging   
lo  how that he  which firste said this thing  
of philosophers father was  hermes  
he saith  how that the dragon doubteless 
he dieth not  but if that he be slain 
with his brother  and this is for to sayn  
by the dragon  mercury  and none other  
he understood  and brimstone by his brother  
that out of sol and luna were y draw  
 and therefore   said he   take heed to my saw  
let no man busy him this art to seech  
but if that he th intention and speech 
of philosophers understande can  
and if he do  he is a lewed man  
for this science and this conning   quoth he  
 is of the secret of secrets pardie   
also there was a disciple of plato  
that on a time said his master to  
as his book  senior  will bear witness  
and this was his demand in soothfastness  
 tell me the name of thilke privy stone   
and plato answer d unto him anon  
 take the stone that titanos men name   
 which is that   quoth he   magnesia is the same   
saide plato   yea  sir  and is it thus  
this is ignotum per ignotius  
what is magnesia  good sir  i pray   
 it is a water that is made  i say  
of th  elementes foure   quoth plato  
 tell me the roote  good sir   quoth he tho  
 of that water  if that it be your will   
 nay  nay   quoth plato   certain that i n ill  
the philosophers sworn were every one  
that they should not discover it to none  
nor in no book it write in no mannere  
for unto god it is so lefe and dear  
that he will not that it discover d be  
but where it liketh to his deity 
man for to inspire  and eke for to defend  
whom that he liketh  lo  this is the end   
then thus conclude i  since that god of heaven 
will not that these philosophers neven 
how that a man shall come unto this stone  
i rede as for the best to let it gon  
for whoso maketh god his adversary  
as for to work any thing in contrary 
of his will  certes never shall he thrive  
though that he multiply term of his live  
and there a point  for ended is my tale  
god send ev ry good man boot of his bale  
the manciple s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
weet ye not where there stands a little town  
which that y called is bob up and down  
under the blee  in canterbury way  
there gan our hoste for to jape and play  
and saide   sirs  what  dun is in the mire  
is there no man  for prayer nor for hire  
that will awaken our fellow behind  
a thief him might full rob and bind 
see how he nappeth  see  for cocke s bones  
as he would falle from his horse at ones  
is that a cook of london  with mischance  
do him come forth  he knoweth his penance  
for he shall tell a tale  by my fay  
although it be not worth a bottle hay  
awake  thou cook   quoth he   god give thee sorrow 
what aileth thee to sleepe by the morrow  
hast thou had fleas all night  or art drunk  
or had thou with some quean all night y swunk  
so that thou mayest not hold up thine head   
the cook  that was full pale and nothing red  
said to host   so god my soule bless  
as there is fall n on me such heaviness  
i know not why  that me were lever sleep  
than the best gallon wine that is in cheap   
 well   quoth the manciple   if it may do ease 
to thee  sir cook  and to no wight displease 
which that here rideth in this company  
and that our host will of his courtesy  
i will as now excuse thee of thy tale  
for in good faith thy visage is full pale  
thine eyen daze  soothly as me thinketh  
and well i wot  thy breath full soure stinketh  
that sheweth well thou art not well disposed  
of me certain thou shalt not be y glosed  
see how he yawneth  lo  this drunken wight  
as though he would us swallow anon right  
hold close thy mouth  man  by thy father s kin  
the devil of helle set his foot therein  
thy cursed breath infecte will us all  
fy  stinking swine  fy  foul may thee befall  
ah  take heed  sirs  of this lusty man  
now  sweete sir  will ye joust at the fan  
thereto  me thinketh  ye be well y shape  
i trow that ye have drunken wine of ape  
and that is when men playe with a straw   
and with this speech the cook waxed all wraw  
and on the manciple he gan nod fast 
for lack of speech  and down his horse him cast  
where as he lay  till that men him up took  
this was a fair chevachie of a cook  
alas  that he had held him by his ladle  
and ere that he again were in the saddle 
there was great shoving bothe to and fro 
to lift him up  and muche care and woe  
so unwieldy was this silly paled ghost  
and to the manciple then spake our host  
 because that drink hath domination 
upon this man  by my salvation 
i trow he lewedly will tell his tale  
for were it wine  or old or moisty ale  
that he hath drunk  he speaketh in his nose  
and sneezeth fast  and eke he hath the pose 
he also hath to do more than enough 
to keep him on his capel out of the slough  
and if he fall from off his capel eftsoon  
then shall we alle have enough to do n 
in lifting up his heavy drunken corse  
tell on thy tale  of him make i no force  
but yet  manciple  in faith thou art too nice 
thus openly to reprove him of his vice  
another day he will paraventure 
reclaime thee  and bring thee to the lure  
i mean  he speake will of smalle things  
as for to pinchen at thy reckonings  
that were not honest  if it came to prefe   
quoth the manciple   that were a great mischief  
so might he lightly bring me in the snare  
yet had i lever paye for the mare 
which he rides on  than he should with me strive  
i will not wrathe him  so may i thrive 
that that i spake  i said it in my bourde  
and weet ye what  i have here in my gourd 
a draught of wine  yea  of a ripe grape  
and right anon ye shall see a good jape  
this cook shall drink thereof  if that i may  
on pain of my life he will not say nay   
and certainly  to tellen as it was  
of this vessel the cook drank fast alas  
what needed it  he drank enough beforn  
and when he hadde pouped in his horn  
to the manciple he took the gourd again  
and of that drink the cook was wondrous fain  
and thanked him in such wise as he could  
then gan our host to laughe wondrous loud  
and said   i see well it is necessary 
where that we go good drink with us to carry  
for that will turne rancour and disease 
t accord and love  and many a wrong appease  
o bacchus  bacchus  blessed be thy name  
that so canst turnen earnest into game  
worship and thank be to thy deity  
of that mattere ye get no more of me  
tell on thy tale  manciple  i thee pray   
 well  sir   quoth he   now hearken what i say   
 
the tale  
 
when phoebus dwelled here in earth adown  
as olde bookes make mentioun  
he was the moste lusty bacheler 
of all this world  and eke the best archer  
he slew python the serpent  as he lay 
sleeping against the sun upon a day  
and many another noble worthy deed 
he with his bow wrought  as men maye read  
playen he could on every minstrelsy  
and singe  that it was a melody 
to hearen of his cleare voice the soun   
certes the king of thebes  amphioun  
that with his singing walled the city  
could never singe half so well as he  
thereto he was the seemlieste man 
that is  or was since that the world began  
what needeth it his features to descrive  
for in this world is none so fair alive  
he was therewith full fill d of gentleness  
of honour  and of perfect worthiness  
this phoebus  that was flower of bach lery  
as well in freedom as in chivalry  
for his disport  in sign eke of victory 
of python  so as telleth us the story  
was wont to bearen in his hand a bow  
now had this phoebus in his house a crow  
which in a cage he foster d many a day  
and taught it speaken  as men teach a jay  
white was this crow  as is a snow white swan  
and counterfeit the speech of every man 
he coulde  when he shoulde tell a tale  
therewith in all this world no nightingale 
ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal 
singe so wondrous merrily and well  
now had this phoebus in his house a wife  
which that he loved more than his life  
and night and day did ever his diligence 
her for to please  and do her reverence  
save only  if that i the sooth shall sayn  
jealous he was  and would have kept her fain  
for him were loth y japed for to be  
and so is every wight in such degree  
but all for nought  for it availeth nought  
a good wife  that is clean of work and thought  
should not be kept in none await certain  
and truely the labour is in vain 
to keep a shrewe  for it will not be  
this hold i for a very nicety  
to spille labour for to keepe wives  
thus writen olde clerkes in their lives  
but now to purpose  as i first began  
this worthy phoebus did all that he can 
to please her  weening  through such pleasance  
and for his manhood and his governance  
that no man should have put him from her grace  
but  god it wot  there may no man embrace 
as to distrain a thing  which that nature 
hath naturally set in a creature  
take any bird  and put it in a cage  
and do all thine intent  and thy corage  
to foster it tenderly with meat and drink 
of alle dainties that thou canst bethink  
and keep it all so cleanly as thou may  
although the cage of gold be never so gay  
yet had this bird  by twenty thousand fold  
lever in a forest  both wild and cold  
go eate wormes  and such wretchedness  
for ever this bird will do his business 
t escape out of his cage when that he may  
his liberty the bird desireth aye  
let take a cat  and foster her with milk 
and tender flesh  and make her couch of silk  
and let her see a mouse go by the wall  
anon she weiveth milk  and flesh  and all  
and every dainty that is in that house  
such appetite hath she to eat the mouse  
lo  here hath kind her domination  
and appetite flemeth discretion  
a she wolf hath also a villain s kind 
the lewedeste wolf that she may find  
or least of reputation  will she take 
in time when her lust to have a make  
all these examples speak i by these men 
that be untrue  and nothing by women  
for men have ever a lik rous appetite 
on lower things to perform their delight 
than on their wives  be they never so fair  
never so true  nor so debonair  
flesh is so newefangled  with mischance  
that we can in no thinge have pleasance 
that souneth unto virtue any while  
this phoebus  which that thought upon no guile  
deceived was for all his jollity  
for under him another hadde she  
a man of little reputation  
nought worth to phoebus in comparison  
the more harm is  it happens often so  
of which there cometh muche harm and woe  
and so befell  when phoebus was absent  
his wife anon hath for her leman sent  
her leman  certes that is a knavish speech  
forgive it me  and that i you beseech  
the wise plato saith  as ye may read  
the word must needs accorde with the deed  
if men shall telle properly a thing  
the word must cousin be to the working  
i am a boistous man  right thus i say  
there is no difference truely 
betwixt a wife that is of high degree 
if of her body dishonest she be  
and any poore wench  other than this 
if it so be they worke both amiss  
but  for the gentle is in estate above  
she shall be call d his lady and his love  
and  for that other is a poor woman  
she shall be call d his wench and his leman  
and god it wot  mine owen deare brother  
men lay the one as low as lies the other  
right so betwixt a titleless tyrant 
and an outlaw  or else a thief errant  
the same i say  there is no difference 
to alexander told was this sentence  
but  for the tyrant is of greater might 
by force of meinie for to slay downright  
and burn both house and home  and make all plain  
lo  therefore is he call d a capitain  
and  for the outlaw hath but small meinie  
and may not do so great an harm as he  
nor bring a country to so great mischief  
men calle him an outlaw or a thief  
but  for i am a man not textuel  
i will not tell of texts never a deal  
i will go to my tale  as i began  
when phoebus  wife had sent for her leman  
anon they wroughten all their lust volage  
this white crow  that hung aye in the cage  
beheld their work  and said never a word  
and when that home was come phoebus the lord  
this crowe sung   cuckoo  cuckoo  cuckoo   
 what  bird   quoth phoebus   what song sing st thou now  
wert thou not wont so merrily to sing  
that to my heart it was a rejoicing 
to hear thy voice  alas  what song is this   
 by god   quoth he   i singe not amiss  
phoebus   quoth he   for all thy worthiness  
for all thy beauty  and all thy gentleness  
for all thy song  and all thy minstrelsy  
for all thy waiting  bleared is thine eye 
with one of little reputation  thou art befooled 
not worth to thee  as in comparison  
the mountance of a gnat  so may i thrive  
for on thy bed thy wife i saw him swive   
what will ye more  the crow anon him told  
by sade tokens  and by wordes bold  
how that his wife had done her lechery  
to his great shame and his great villainy  
and told him oft  he saw it with his eyen  
this phoebus gan awayward for to wrien  
him thought his woeful hearte burst in two  
his bow he bent  and set therein a flo  
and in his ire he hath his wife slain  
this is th  effect  there is no more to sayn  
for sorrow of which he brake his minstrelsy  
both harp and lute  gitern and psaltery  
and eke he brake his arrows and his bow  
and after that thus spake he to the crow  
 traitor   quoth he   with tongue of scorpion  
thou hast me brought to my confusion  
alas that i was wrought  why n ere i dead  
o deare wife  o gem of lustihead  
that wert to me so sad  and eke so true  
now liest thou dead  with face pale of hue  
full guilteless  that durst i swear y wis  
o rakel hand  to do so foul amiss 
o troubled wit  o ire reckeless  
that unadvised smit st the guilteless  
o wantrust  full of false suspicion  
where was thy wit and thy discretion  
o  every man beware of rakelness  
nor trow no thing withoute strong witness  
smite not too soon  ere that ye weete 
and be advised well and sickerly 
ere ye any execution 
upon your ire for suspicion  
alas  a thousand folk hath rakel ire 
foully fordone  and brought them in the mire  
alas  for sorrow i will myself slee 
and to the crow   o false thief   said he  
 i will thee quite anon thy false tale  
thou sung whilom like any nightingale  
now shalt thou  false thief  thy song foregon  
and eke thy white feathers every one  
nor ever in all thy life shalt thou speak  
thus shall men on a traitor be awreak  
thou and thine offspring ever shall be blake  
nor ever sweete noise shall ye make  
but ever cry against tempest and rain  
in token that through thee my wife is slain   
and to the crow he start  and that anon  
and pull d his white feathers every one  
and made him black  and reft him all his song  
and eke his speech  and out at door him flung 
unto the devil  which i him betake  
and for this cause be all crowes blake  
lordings  by this ensample  i you pray  
beware  and take keep what that ye say  
nor telle never man in all your life 
how that another man hath dight his wife  
he will you hate mortally certain  
dan solomon  as wise clerkes sayn  
teacheth a man to keep his tongue well  
but  as i said  i am not textuel  
but natheless thus taughte me my dame  
 my son  think on the crow  in godde s name  
my son  keep well thy tongue  and keep thy friend  
a wicked tongue is worse than is a fiend  
my sone  from a fiend men may them bless  
my son  god of his endeless goodness themselves 
walled a tongue with teeth  and lippes eke  
for man should him advise  what he speak  
my son  full often for too muche speech 
hath many a man been spilt  as clerkes teach  
but for a little speech advisedly 
is no man shent  to speak generally  
my son  thy tongue shouldest thou restrain 
at alle time  but when thou dost thy pain 
to speak of god in honour and prayere  
the firste virtue  son  if thou wilt lear  
is to restrain and keepe well thy tongue  
thus learne children  when that they be young  
my son  of muche speaking evil advis d  
where lesse speaking had enough suffic d  
cometh much harm  thus was me told and taught  
in muche speeche sinne wanteth not  
wost thou whereof a rakel tongue serveth  
right as a sword forcutteth and forcarveth 
an arm in two  my deare son  right so 
a tongue cutteth friendship all in two  
a jangler is to god abominable  
read solomon  so wise and honourable  
read david in his psalms  and read senec   
my son  speak not  but with thine head thou beck  
dissimule as thou wert deaf  if that thou hear 
a jangler speak of perilous mattere  
the fleming saith  and learn if that thee lest  
that little jangling causeth muche rest  
my son  if thou no wicked word hast said  
thee thar not dreade for to be bewray d  
but he that hath missaid  i dare well sayn  fear to be betrayed 
he may by no way call his word again  
thing that is said is said  and forth it go th  
though him repent  or be he ne er so loth  
he is his thrall  to whom that he hath said 
a tale  of which he is now evil apaid  
my son  beware  and be no author new 
of tidings  whether they be false or true  
whereso thou come  amonges high or low  
keep well thy tongue  and think upon the crow   
 
the parson s tale  
 
the prologue  
 
by that the manciple his tale had ended  
the sunne from the south line was descended 
so lowe  that it was not to my sight 
degrees nine and twenty as in height  
four of the clock it was then  as i guess  
for eleven foot  a little more or less  
my shadow was at thilke time  as there  
of such feet as my lengthe parted were 
in six feet equal of proportion  
therewith the moone s exaltation  
in meane libra  gan alway ascend  
as we were ent ring at a thorpe s end  
for which our host  as he was wont to gie  
as in this case  our jolly company  
said in this wise   lordings every one  
now lacketh us no more tales than one  
fulfill d is my sentence and my decree  
i trow that we have heard of each degree  
almost fulfilled is mine ordinance  in the company 
i pray to god so give him right good chance 
that telleth us this tale lustily  
sir priest   quoth he   art thou a vicary  
or art thou a parson  say sooth by thy fay  
be what thou be  breake thou not our play  
for every man  save thou  hath told his tale  
unbuckle  and shew us what is in thy mail  
for truely me thinketh by thy cheer 
thou shouldest knit up well a great mattere  
tell us a fable anon  for cocke s bones   
this parson him answered all at ones  
 thou gettest fable none y told for me  
for paul  that writeth unto timothy  
reproveth them that weive soothfastness  
and telle fables  and such wretchedness  
why should i sowe draff out of my fist  
when i may sowe wheat  if that me list  
for which i say  if that you list to hear 
morality and virtuous mattere  
and then that ye will give me audience  
i would full fain at christe s reverence 
do you pleasance lawful  as i can  
but  truste well  i am a southern man  
i cannot gest  rom  ram  ruf  by my letter  
and  god wot  rhyme hold i but little better  
and therefore if you list  i will not glose  
i will you tell a little tale in prose  
to knit up all this feast  and make an end  
and jesus for his grace wit me send 
to shewe you the way  in this voyage  
of thilke perfect glorious pilgrimage  
that hight jerusalem celestial  
and if ye vouchesafe  anon i shall 
begin upon my tale  for which i pray 
tell your advice  i can no better say  
but natheless this meditation 
i put it aye under correction 
of clerkes  for i am not textuel  
i take but the sentence  trust me well  
therefore i make a protestation  
that i will stande to correction   
upon this word we have assented soon  
for  as us seemed  it was for to do n  
to enden in some virtuous sentence  
and for to give him space and audience  
and bade our host he shoulde to him say 
that alle we to tell his tale him pray  
our hoste had  the wordes for us all  
 sir priest   quoth he   now faire you befall  
say what you list  and we shall gladly hear   
and with that word he said in this mannere  
 telle   quoth he   your meditatioun  
but hasten you  the sunne will adown  
be fructuous  and that in little space  
and to do well god sende you his grace   
 
the tale  
 
 
 
our sweet lord god of heaven  that no man will perish  but will that we come all to the knowledge of him  and to the blissful life that is perdurable  admonishes us by the prophet jeremiah  that saith in this wise   stand upon the ways  and see and ask of old paths  that is to say  of old sentences  which is the good way  and walk in that way  and ye shall find refreshing for your souls    c  many be the spiritual ways that lead folk to our lord jesus christ  and to the reign of glory  of which ways there is a full noble way  and full convenable  which may not fail to man nor to woman  that through sin hath misgone from the right way of jerusalem celestial  and this way is called penitence  of which men should gladly hearken and inquire with all their hearts  to wit what is penitence  and whence it is called penitence  and in what manner  and in how many manners  be the actions or workings of penitence  and how many species there be of penitences  and what things appertain and behove to penitence  and what things disturb penitence  
 
penitence is described  on the authority of saints ambrose  isidore  and gregory  as the bewailing of sin that has been wrought  with the purpose never again to do that thing  or any other thing which a man should bewail  for weeping and not ceasing to do the sin will not avail   though it is to be hoped that after every time that a man falls  be it ever so often  he may find grace to arise through penitence  and repentant folk that leave their sin ere sin leave them  are accounted by holy church sure of their salvation  even though the repentance be at the last hour  there are three actions of penitence  that a man be baptized after he has sinned  that he do no deadly sin after receiving baptism  and that he fall into no venial sins from day to day   thereof saith st augustine  that penitence of good and humble folk is the penitence of every day   the species of penitence are three  solemn  when a man is openly expelled from holy church in lent  or is compelled by holy church to do open penance for an open sin openly talked of in the country  common penance  enjoined by priests in certain cases  as to go on pilgrimage naked or barefoot  and privy penance  which men do daily for private sins  of which they confess privately and receive private penance  to very perfect penitence are behoveful and necessary three things  contrition of heart  confession of mouth  and satisfaction  which are fruitful penitence against delight in thinking  reckless speech  and wicked sinful works  
 
penitence may be likened to a tree  having its root in contrition  biding itself in the heart as a tree root does in the earth  out of this root springs a stalk  that bears branches and leaves of confession  and fruit of satisfaction  of this root also springs a seed of grace  which is mother of all security  and this seed is eager and hot  and the grace of this seed springs of god  through remembrance on the day of judgment and on the pains of hell  the heat of this seed is the love of god  and the desire of everlasting joy  and this heat draws the heart of man to god  and makes him hate his sin  penance is the tree of life to them that receive it  in penance or contrition man shall understand four things  what is contrition  what are the causes that move a man to contrition  how he should be contrite  and what contrition availeth to the soul  contrition is the heavy and grievous sorrow that a man receiveth in his heart for his sins  with earnest purpose to confess and do penance  and never more to sin  six causes ought to move a man to contrition  1  he should remember him of his sins  2  he should reflect that sin putteth a man in great thraldom  and all the greater the higher is the estate from which he falls  3  he should dread the day of doom and the horrible pains of hell  4  the sorrowful remembrance of the good deeds that man hath omitted to do here on earth  and also the good that he hath lost  ought to make him have contrition  5  so also ought the remembrance of the passion that our lord jesus christ suffered for our sins  6  and so ought the hope of three things  that is to say  forgiveness of sin  the gift of grace to do well  and the glory of heaven with which god shall reward man for his good deeds    all these points the parson illustrates and enforces at length  waxing especially eloquent under the third head  and plainly setting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future punishments that were entertained in the time of chaucer    
 
certes  all the sorrow that a man might make from the beginning of the world  is but a little thing  at retard of the sorrow of hell  the cause why that job calleth hell the land of darkness  understand  that he calleth it land or earth  for it is stable and never shall fail  and dark  for he that is in hell hath default of light natural  for certes the dark light  that shall come out of the fire that ever shall burn  shall turn them all to pain that be in hell  for it sheweth them the horrible devils that them torment  covered with the darkness of death  that is to say  that he that is in hell shall have default of the sight of god  for certes the sight of god is the life perdurable  the darkness of death  be the sins that the wretched man hath done  which that disturb him to see the face of god  right as a dark cloud doth between us and the sun  land of misease  because there be three manner of defaults against three things that folk of this world have in this present life  that is to say  honours  delights  and riches  against honour have they in hell shame and confusion  for well ye wot  that men call honour the reverence that man doth to man  but in hell is no honour nor reverence  for certes no more reverence shall be done there to a king than to a knave  for which god saith by the prophet jeremiah   the folk that me despise shall be in despite   honour is also called great lordship  there shall no wight serve other  but of harm and torment  honour is also called great dignity and highness  but in hell shall they be all fortrodden of devils  as god saith   the horrible devils shall go and come upon the heads of damned folk   and this is  forasmuch as the higher that they were in this present life  the more shall they be abated and defouled in hell  against the riches of this world shall they have misease of poverty  and this poverty shall be in four things  in default of treasure  of which david saith   the rich folk that embraced and oned all their heart to treasure of this world  shall sleep in the sleeping of death  and nothing shall they find in their hands of all their treasure   and moreover  the misease of hell shall be in default of meat and drink  for god saith thus by moses   they shall be wasted with hunger  and the birds of hell shall devour them with bitter death  and the gall of the dragon shall be their drink  and the venom of the dragon their morsels   and furthermore  their misease shall be in default of clothing  for they shall be naked in body  as of clothing  save the fire in which they burn  and other filths  and naked shall they be in soul  of all manner virtues  which that is the clothing of the soul  where be then the gay robes  and the soft sheets  and the fine shirts  lo  what saith of them the prophet isaiah  that under them shall be strewed moths  and their covertures shall be of worms of hell  and furthermore  their misease shall be in default of friends  for he is not poor that hath good friends  but there is no friend  for neither god nor any good creature shall be friend to them  and evereach of them shall hate other with deadly hate  the sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and mother  and kindred against kindred  and chide and despise each other  both day and night  as god saith by the prophet micah  and the loving children  that whom loved so fleshly each other  would each of them eat the other if they might  for how should they love together in the pains of hell  when they hated each other in the prosperity of this life  for trust well  their fleshly love was deadly hate  as saith the prophet david   whoso loveth wickedness  he hateth his own soul   and whoso hateth his own soul  certes he may love none other wight in no manner  and therefore in hell is no solace nor no friendship  but ever the more kindreds that be in hell  the more cursing  the more chiding  and the more deadly hate there is among them  and furtherover  they shall have default of all manner delights  for certes delights be after the appetites of the five wits  as sight  hearing  smelling  savouring  and touching  but in hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of smoke  and their eyes full of tears  and their hearing full of waimenting and grinting of teeth  as saith jesus christ  their nostrils shall be full of stinking  and  as saith isaiah the prophet  their savouring shall be full of bitter gall  and touching of all their body shall be covered with fire that never shall quench  and with worms that never shall die  as god saith by the mouth of isaiah  and forasmuch as they shall not ween that they may die for pain  and by death flee from pain  that may they understand in the word of job  that saith   there is the shadow of death   certes a shadow hath the likeness of the thing of which it is shadowed  but the shadow is not the same thing of which it is shadowed  right so fareth the pain of hell  it is like death  for the horrible anguish  and why  for it paineth them ever as though they should die anon  but certes they shall not die  for  as saith saint gregory   to wretched caitiffs shall be given death without death  and end without end  and default without failing  for their death shall always live  and their end shall evermore begin  and their default shall never fail   and therefore saith saint john the evangelist   they shall follow death  and they shall not find him  and they shall desire to die  and death shall flee from them   and eke job saith  that in hell is no order of rule  and albeit that god hath created all things in right order  and nothing without order  but all things be ordered and numbered  yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order  nor hold no order  for the earth shall bear them no fruit for  as the prophet david saith   god shall destroy the fruit of the earth  as for them   nor water shall give them no moisture  nor the air no refreshing  nor the fire no light  for as saith saint basil   the burning of the fire of this world shall god give in hell to them that be damned  but the light and the clearness shall be given in heaven to his children  right as the good man giveth flesh to his children  and bones to his hounds   and for they shall have no hope to escape  saith job at last  that there shall horror and grisly dread dwell without end  horror is always dread of harm that is to come  and this dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned  and therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes  first  for god that is their judge shall be without mercy to them  nor they may not please him  nor none of his hallows  nor they may give nothing for their ransom  nor they have no voice to speak to him  nor they may not flee from pain  nor they have no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them from pain  
 
 
 
the courteous lord jesus christ will that no good work be lost  for in somewhat it shall avail  but forasmuch as the good works that men do while they be in good life be all amortised by sin following  and also since all the good works that men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead  as for to have the life perdurable  well may that man that no good works doth  sing that new french song  j ai tout perdu   mon temps et mon labour  for certes  sin bereaveth a man both the goodness of nature  and eke the goodness of grace  for soothly the grace of the holy ghost fareth like fire  that may not be idle  for fire faileth anon as it forleteth its working  and right so grace faileth anon as it forleteth its working  then loseth the sinful man the goodness of glory  that only is to good men that labour and work  well may he be sorry then  that oweth all his life to god  as long as he hath lived  and also as long as he shall live  that no goodness hath to pay with his debt to god  to whom he oweth all his life  for trust well he shall give account  as saith saint bernard  of all the goods that have been given him in his present life  and how he hath them dispended  insomuch that there shall not perish an hair of his head  nor a moment of an hour shall not perish of his time  that he shall not give thereof a reckoning  
 
 of sin  and restoreth it to all goods spiritual  and to the company and communion of holy church   he who should set his intent to these things  would no longer be inclined to sin  but would give his heart and body to the service of jesus christ  and thereof do him homage   for  certes  our lord jesus christ hath spared us so benignly in our follies  that if he had not pity on man s soul  a sorry song might we all sing   
 
the second part of the parson s tale or treatise opens with an explanation of what is confession   which is termed  the second part of penitence  that is  sign of contrition   whether it ought needs be done or not  and what things be convenable to true confession  confession is true shewing of sins to the priest  without excusing  hiding  or forwrapping of anything  and without vaunting of good works   also  it is necessary to understand whence that sins spring  and how they increase  and which they be   from adam we took original sin   from him fleshly descended be we all  and engendered of vile and corrupt matter   and the penalty of adam s transgression dwelleth with us as to temptation  which penalty is called concupiscence   this concupiscence  when it is wrongfully disposed or ordained in a man  it maketh him covet  by covetise of flesh  fleshly sin by sight of his eyes  as to earthly things  and also covetise of highness by pride of heart   the parson proceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin  how  after his natural concupiscence  comes suggestion of the devil  that is to say the devil s bellows  with which he bloweth in man the fire of con cupiscence  and how man then bethinketh him whether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted  if he flame up into pleasure at the thought  and give way  then is he all dead in soul   and thus is sin accomplished  by temptation  by delight  and by consenting  and then is the sin actual   sin is either venial  or deadly  deadly  when a man loves any creature more than jesus christ our creator  venial  if he love jesus christ less than he ought  venial sins diminish man s love to god more and more  and may in this wise skip into deadly sin  for many small make a great   and hearken this example  a great wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a violence  that it drencheth the ship  and the same harm do sometimes the small drops  of water that enter through a little crevice in the thurrok  and in the bottom of the ship  if men be so negligent that they discharge them not betimes  and therefore  although there be difference betwixt these two causes of drenching  algates the ship is dreint  right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin   and of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to make him love worldly things more than god  the parson then enumerates specially a number of sins which many a man peradventure deems no sins  and confesses them not  and yet nevertheless they are truly sins      
 
this is to say  at every time that a man eateth and drinketh more than sufficeth to the sustenance of his body  in certain he doth sin  eke when he speaketh more than it needeth  he doth sin  eke when he heareth not benignly the complaint of the poor  eke when he is in health of body  and will not fast when other folk fast  without cause reasonable  eke when he sleepeth more than needeth  or when he cometh by that occasion too late to church  or to other works of charity  eke when he useth his wife without sovereign desire of engendrure  to the honour of god  or for the intent to yield his wife his debt of his body  eke when he will not visit the sick  or the prisoner  if he may  eke if he love wife  or child  or other worldly thing  more than reason requireth  eke if he flatter or blandish more than he ought for any necessity  eke if he minish or withdraw the alms of the poor  eke if he apparail his meat more deliciously than need is  or eat it too hastily by likerousness  eke if he talk vanities in the church  or at god s service  or that he be a talker of idle words of folly or villainy  for he shall yield account of them at the day of doom  eke when he behighteth or assureth to do things that he may not perform  eke when that by lightness of folly he missayeth or scorneth his neighbour  eke when he hath any wicked suspicion of thing  that he wot of it no soothfastness  these things  and more without number  be sins  as saith saint augustine  
 
  and by blessing of bishops and priests  and by other good works   the parson then proceeds to weightier matters     
 
now it is behovely to tell which be deadly sins  that is to say  chieftains of sins  forasmuch as all they run in one leash  but in diverse manners  now be they called chieftains  forasmuch as they be chief  and of them spring all other sins  the root of these sins  then  is pride  the general root of all harms  for of this root spring certain branches  as ire  envy  accidie or sloth  avarice or covetousness to common understanding  gluttony  and lechery  and each of these sins hath his branches and his twigs  as shall be declared in their chapters following  and though so be  that no man can tell utterly the number of the twigs  and of the harms that come of pride  yet will i shew a part of them  as ye shall understand  there is inobedience  vaunting  hypocrisy  despite  arrogance  impudence  swelling of hearte  insolence  elation  impatience  strife  contumacy  presumption  irreverence  pertinacity  vain  glory and many another twig that i cannot tell nor declare         
 
and yet there is a privy species of pride that waiteth first to be saluted ere he will salute  all be he less worthy than that other is  and eke he waiteth or desireth to sit or to go above him in the way  or kiss the pax  or be incensed  or go to offering before his neighbour  and such semblable things  against his duty peradventure  but that he hath his heart and his intent in such a proud desire to be magnified and honoured before the people  now be there two manner of prides  the one of them is within the heart of a man  and the other is without  of which soothly these foresaid things  and more than i have said  appertain to pride that is within the heart of a man and there be other species of pride that be without  but nevertheless  the one of these species of pride is sign of the other  right as the gay levesell at the tavern is sign of the wine that is in the cellar  and this is in many things  as in speech and countenance  and outrageous array of clothing  for certes  if there had been no sin in clothing  christ would not so soon have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man in the gospel  and saint gregory saith  that precious clothing is culpable for the dearth of it  and for its softness  and for its strangeness and disguising  and for the superfluity or for the inordinate scantness of it  alas  may not a man see in our days the sinful costly array of clothing  and namely in too much superfluity  or else in too disordinate scantness  as to the first sin  in superfluity of clothing  which that maketh it so dear  to the harm of the people  not only the cost of the embroidering  the disguising  indenting or barring  ounding  paling  winding  or banding  and semblable waste of cloth in vanity  but there is also the costly furring in their gowns  so much punching of chisels to make holes  so much dagging of shears  with the superfluity in length of the foresaid gowns  trailing in the dung and in the mire  on horse and eke on foot  as well of man as of woman  that all that trailing is verily as in effect wasted  consumed  threadbare  and rotten with dung  rather than it is given to the poor  to great damage of the foresaid poor folk  and that in sundry wise  this is to say  the more that cloth is wasted  the more must it cost to the poor people for the scarceness  and furthermore  if so be that they would give such punched and dagged clothing to the poor people  it is not convenient to wear for their estate  nor sufficient to boot their necessity  to keep them from the distemperance of the firmament  upon the other side  to speak of the horrible disordinate scantness of clothing  as be these cutted slops or hanselines  that through their shortness cover not the shameful member of man  to wicked intent alas  some of them shew the boss and the shape of the horrible swollen members  that seem like to the malady of hernia  in the wrapping of their hosen  and eke the buttocks of them  that fare as it were the hinder part of a she ape in the full of the moon  and more over the wretched swollen members that they shew through disguising  in departing of their hosen in white and red  seemeth that half their shameful privy members were flain  and if so be that they depart their hosen in other colours  as is white and blue  or white and black  or black and red  and so forth  then seemeth it  by variance of colour  that the half part of their privy members be corrupt by the fire of saint anthony  or by canker  or other such mischance  and of the hinder part of their buttocks it is full horrible to see  for certes  in that part of their body where they purge their stinking ordure  that foul part shew they to the people proudly in despite of honesty  which honesty jesus christ and his friends observed to shew in his life  now as of the outrageous array of women  god wot  that though the visages of some of them seem full chaste and debonair  yet notify they  in their array of attire  likerousness and pride  i say not that honesty in clothing of man or woman unconvenable but  certes  the superfluity or disordinate scarcity of clothing is reprovable  also the sin of their ornament  or of apparel  as in things that appertain to riding  as in too many delicate horses  that be holden for delight  that be so fair  fat  and costly  and also in many a vicious knave  that is sustained because of them  in curious harness  as in saddles  cruppers  peytrels  and bridles  covered with precious cloth and rich bars and plates of gold and silver  for which god saith by zechariah the prophet   i will confound the riders of such horses   these folk take little regard of the riding of god s son of heaven  and of his harness  when he rode upon an ass  and had no other harness but the poor clothes of his disciples  nor we read not that ever he rode on any other beast  i speak this for the sin of superfluity  and not for reasonable honesty  when reason it requireth  and moreover  certes  pride is greatly notified in holding of great meinie  when they be of little profit or of right no profit  and namely when that meinie is felonous and damageous to the people by hardiness of high lordship  or by way of office  for certes  such lords sell then their lordship to the devil of hell  when they sustain the wickedness of their meinie  or else  when these folk of low degree  as they that hold hostelries  sustain theft of their hostellers  and that is in many manner of deceits  that manner of folk be the flies that follow the honey  or else the hounds that follow the carrion  such foresaid folk strangle spiritually their lordships  for which thus saith david the prophet   wicked death may come unto these lordships  and god give that they may descend into hell adown  for in their houses is iniquity and shrewedness  and not god of heaven   and certes  but if they do amendment  right as god gave his benison to laban by the service of jacob  and to pharaoh by the service of joseph  right so god will give his malison to such lordships as sustain the wickedness of their servants  but they come to amendment  pride of the table apaireth eke full oft  for  certes  rich men be called to feasts  and poor folk be put away and rebuked  also in excess of divers meats and drinks  and namely such manner bake meats and dish meats burning of wild fire  and painted and castled with paper  and semblable waste  so that it is abuse to think  and eke in too great preciousness of vessel  and curiosity of minstrelsy  by which a man is stirred more to the delights of luxury  if so be that he set his heart the less upon our lord jesus christ  certain it is a sin  and certainly the delights might be so great in this case  that a man might lightly fall by them into deadly sin  
 
 
 
now be there three manners of humility  as humility in heart  and another in the mouth  and the third in works  the humility in the heart is in four manners  the one is  when a man holdeth himself as nought worth before god of heaven  the second is  when he despiseth no other man  the third is  when he recketh not though men hold him nought worth  the fourth is  when he is not sorry of his humiliation  also the humility of mouth is in four things  in temperate speech  in humility of speech  and when he confesseth with his own mouth that he is such as he thinketh that he is in his heart  another is  when he praiseth the bounte of another man and nothing thereof diminisheth  humility eke in works is in four manners  the first is  when he putteth other men before him  the second is  to choose the lowest place of all  the third is  gladly to assent to good counsel  the fourth is  to stand gladly by the award of his sovereign  or of him that is higher in degree  certain this is a great work of humility  
 
 that christ shall give at the day of doom to them that shall be damned  6  gluttony    of which the parson treats so briefly that the chapter may be given in full      
 
after avarice cometh gluttony  which is express against the commandment of god  gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat or to drink  or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite and disordered covetousness to eat or drink  this sin corrupted all this world  as is well shewed in the sin of adam and of eve  look also what saith saint paul of gluttony   many   saith he   go  of which i have oft said to you  and now i say it weeping  that they be enemies of the cross of christ  of which the end is death  and of which their womb is their god and their glory   in confusion of them that so savour earthly things  he that is usant to this sin of gluttony  he may no sin withstand  he must be in servage of all vices  for it is the devil s hoard  where he hideth him in and resteth  this sin hath many species  the first is drunkenness  that is the horrible sepulture of man s reason  and therefore when a man is drunken  he hath lost his reason  and this is deadly sin  but soothly  when that a man is not wont to strong drink  and peradventure knoweth not the strength of the drink  or hath feebleness in his head  or hath travailed  through which he drinketh the more  all be he suddenly caught with drink  it is no deadly sin  but venial  the second species of gluttony is  that the spirit of a man waxeth all troubled for drunkenness  and bereaveth a man the discretion of his wit  the third species of gluttony is  when a man devoureth his meat  and hath no rightful manner of eating  the fourth is  when  through the great abundance of his meat  the humours of his body be distempered  the fifth is  forgetfulness by too much drinking  for which a man sometimes forgetteth by the morrow what be did at eve  in other manner be distinct the species of gluttony  after saint gregory  the first is  for to eat or drink before time  the second is  when a man getteth him too delicate meat or drink  the third is  when men take too much over measure  the fourth is curiosity with great intent to make and apparel his meat  the fifth is  for to eat too greedily  these be the five fingers of the devil s hand  by which he draweth folk to the sin  
 
against gluttony the remedy is abstinence  as saith galen  but that i hold not meritorious  if he do it only for the health of his body  saint augustine will that abstinence be done for virtue  and with patience  abstinence  saith he  is little worth  but if a man have good will thereto  and but it be enforced by patience and by charity  and that men do it for god s sake  and in hope to have the bliss in heaven  the fellows of abstinence be temperance  that holdeth the mean in all things  also shame  that escheweth all dishonesty  sufficiency  that seeketh no rich meats nor drinks  nor doth no force of no outrageous apparelling of meat  measure also  that restraineth by reason the unmeasurable appetite of eating  soberness also  that restraineth the outrage of drink  sparing also  that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long at meat  wherefore some folk stand of their own will to eat  because they will eat at less leisure  
 
 
 
also thou shalt shrive thee of all thy sins to one man  and not a parcel to one man  and a parcel to another  that is to understand  in intent to depart thy confession for shame or dread  for it is but strangling of thy soul  for certes jesus christ is entirely all good  in him is none imperfection  and therefore either he forgiveth all perfectly  or else never a deal  i say not that if thou be assigned to thy penitencer for a certain sin  that thou art bound to shew him all the remnant of thy sins  of which thou hast been shriven of thy curate  but if it like thee of thy humility  this is no departing of shrift  and i say not  where i speak of division of confession  that if thou have license to shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest  and where thee liketh  and by the license of thy curate  that thou mayest not well shrive thee to him of all thy sins  but let no blot be behind  let no sin be untold as far as thou hast remembrance  and when thou shalt be shriven of thy curate  tell him eke all the sins that thou hast done since thou wert last shriven  this is no wicked intent of division of shrift  also  very shrift asketh certain conditions  first  that thou shrive thee by thy free will  not constrained  nor for shame of folk  nor for malady  or such things  for it is reason  that he that trespasseth by his free will  that by his free will he confess his trespass  and that no other man tell his sin but himself  nor he shall not nay nor deny his sin  nor wrath him against the priest for admonishing him to leave his sin  the second condition is  that thy shrift be lawful  that is to say  that thou that shrivest thee  and eke the priest that heareth thy confession  be verily in the faith of holy church  and that a man be not despaired of the mercy of jesus christ  as cain and judas were  and eke a man must accuse himself of his own trespass  and not another  but he shall blame and wite himself of his own malice and of his sin  and none other  but nevertheless  if that another man be occasion or else enticer of his sin  or the estate of the person be such by which his sin is aggravated  or else that be may not plainly shrive him but he tell the person with which he hath sinned  then may he tell  so that his intent be not to backbite the person  but only to declare his confession  thou shalt not eke make no leasings in thy confession for humility  peradventure  to say that thou hast committed and done such sins of which that thou wert never guilty  for saint augustine saith   if that thou  because of humility  makest a leasing on thyself  though thou were not in sin before  yet art thou then in sin through thy leasing   thou must also shew thy sin by thine own proper mouth  but thou be dumb  and not by letter  for thou that hast done the sin  thou shalt have the shame of the confession  thou shalt not paint thy confession with fair and subtle words  to cover the more thy sin  for then beguilest thou thyself  and not the priest  thou must tell it plainly  be it never so foul nor so horrible  thou shalt eke shrive thee to a priest that is discreet to counsel thee  and eke thou shalt not shrive thee for vain glory  nor for hypocrisy  nor for no cause but only for the doubt of jesus  christ and the health of thy soul  thou shalt not run to the priest all suddenly  to tell him lightly thy sin  as who telleth a jape or a tale  but advisedly and with good devotion  and generally shrive thee oft  if thou oft fall  oft arise by confession  and though thou shrive thee oftener than once of sin of which thou hast been shriven  it is more merit  and  as saith saint augustine  thou shalt have the more lightly release and grace of god  both of sin and of pain  and certes  once a year at the least way  it is lawful to be houseled  for soothly once a year all things in the earth renovelen  
 
 
 
de tertia parte poenitentiae  
 
now have i told you of very confession  that is the second part of penitence  the third part of penitence is satisfaction  and that standeth generally in almsdeed and bodily pain  now be there three manner of almsdeed  contrition of heart  where a man offereth himself to god  the second is  to have pity of the default of his neighbour  the third is  in giving of good counsel and comfort  ghostly and bodily  where men have need  and namely sustenance of man s food  and take keep that a man hath need of these things generally  he hath need of food  of clothing  and of herberow  he hath need of charitable counsel and visiting in prison and malady  and sepulture of his dead body  and if thou mayest not visit the needful with thy person  visit them by thy message and by thy gifts  these be generally alms or works of charity of them that have temporal riches or discretion in counselling  of these works shalt thou hear at the day of doom  this alms shouldest thou do of thine own proper things  and hastily  and privily if thou mayest  but nevertheless  if thou mayest not do it privily  thou shalt not forbear to do alms  though men see it  so that it be not done for thank of the world  but only for thank of jesus christ  for  as witnesseth saint matthew  chap  v    a city may not be hid that is set on a mountain  nor men light not a lantern and put it under a bushel  but men set it on a candlestick  to light the men in the house  right so shall your light lighten before men  that they may see your good works  and glorify your father that is in heaven   
 
now as to speak of bodily pain  it is in prayer  in wakings  in fastings  and in virtuous teachings  of orisons ye shall understand  that orisons or prayers is to say a piteous will of heart  that redresseth it in god  and expresseth it by word outward  to remove harms  and to have things spiritual and durable  and sometimes temporal things  of which orisons  certes in the orison of the pater noster hath our lord jesus christ enclosed most things  certes  it is privileged of three things in its dignity  for which it is more digne than any other prayer  for jesus christ himself made it  and it is short  for it should be coude the more lightly  and to withhold it the more easy in heart  and help himself the oftener with this orison  and for a man should be the less weary to say it  and for a man may not excuse him to learn it  it is so short and so easy  and for it comprehendeth in itself all good prayers  the exposition of this holy prayer  that is so excellent and so digne  i betake to these masters of theology  save thus much will i say  when thou prayest that god should forgive thee thy guilts  as thou forgivest them that they guilt to thee  be full well ware that thou be not out of charity  this holy orison aminisheth eke venial sin  and therefore it appertaineth specially to penitence  this prayer must be truly said  and in very faith  and that men pray to god ordinately  discreetly  and devoutly  and always a man shall put his will to be subject to the will of god  this orison must eke be said with great humbleness and full pure  and honestly  and not to the annoyance of any man or woman  it must eke be continued with the works of charity  it availeth against the vices of the soul  for  assaith saint jerome  by fasting be saved the vices of the flesh  and by prayer the vices of the soul 
 
after this thou shalt understand  that bodily pain stands in waking  for jesus christ saith  wake and pray  that ye enter not into temptation   ye shall understand also  that fasting stands in three things  in forbearing of bodily meat and drink  and in forbearing of worldly jollity  and in forbearing of deadly sin  this is to say  that a man shall keep him from deadly sin in all that he may  and thou shalt understand eke  that god ordained fasting  and to fasting appertain four things  largeness to poor folk  gladness of heart spiritual  not to be angry nor annoyed nor grudge for he fasteth  and also reasonable hour for to eat by measure  that is to say  a man should not eat in untime  nor sit the longer at his meal for he fasteth  then shalt thou understand  that bodily pain standeth in discipline  or teaching  by word  or by writing  or by ensample  also in wearing of hairs or of stamin  or of habergeons on their naked flesh for christ s sake  but ware thee well that such manner penance of thy flesh make not thine heart bitter or angry  nor annoyed of thyself  for better is to cast away thine hair than to cast away the sweetness of our lord jesus christ  and therefore saith saint paul   clothe you  as they that be chosen of god in heart  of misericorde  debonairte  sufferance  and such manner of clothing   of which jesus christ is more apaid than of hairs or of hauberks  then is discipline eke in knocking of thy breast  in scourging with yards  in kneelings  in tribulations  in suffering patiently wrongs that be done to him  and eke in patient sufferance of maladies  or losing of worldly catel  or of wife  or of child  or of other friends  
 
then shalt thou understand which things disturb penance  and this is in four things  that is dread  shame  hope  and wanhope  that is  desperation  and for to speak first of dread  for which he weeneth that he may suffer no penance  thereagainst is remedy for to think that bodily penance is but short and little at the regard of the pain of hell  that is so cruel and so long  that it lasteth without end  now against the shame that a man hath to shrive him  and namely these hypocrites  that would be holden so perfect  that they have no need to shrive them  against that shame should a man think  that by way of reason he that hath not been ashamed to do foul things  certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair things  and that is confession  a man should eke think  that god seeth and knoweth all thy thoughts  and all thy works  to him may nothing be hid nor covered  men should eke remember them of the shame that is to come at the day of doom  to them that be not penitent and shriven in this present life  for all the creatures in heaven  and in earth  and in hell  shall see apertly all that he hideth in this world  
 
now for to speak of them that be so negligent and slow to shrive them  that stands in two manners  the one is  that he hopeth to live long  and to purchase much riches for his delight  and then he will shrive him  and  as he sayeth  he may  as him seemeth  timely enough come to shrift  another is  the surquedrie that he hath in christ s mercy  against the first vice  he shall think that our life is in no sickerness  and eke that all the riches in this world be in adventure  and pass as a shadow on the wall  and  as saith st gregory  that it appertaineth to the great righteousness of god  that never shall the pain stint of them  that never would withdraw them from sin  their thanks  but aye continue in sin  for that perpetual will to do sin shall they have perpetual pain  wanhope is in two manners  the first wanhope is  in the mercy of god  the other is  that they think they might not long persevere in goodness  the first wanhope cometh of that he deemeth that he sinned so highly and so oft  and so long hath lain in sin  that he shall not be saved  certes against that cursed wanhope should he think  that the passion of jesus christ is more strong for to unbind  than sin is strong for to bind  against the second wanhope he shall think  that as oft as he falleth  he may arise again by penitence  and though he never so long hath lain in sin  the mercy of christ is always ready to receive him to mercy  against the wanhope that he thinketh he should not long persevere in goodness  he shall think that the feebleness of the devil may nothing do  but men will suffer him  and eke he shall have strength of the help of god  and of all holy church  and of the protection of angels  if him list  
 
then shall men understand  what is the fruit of penance  and after the word of jesus christ  it is the endless bliss of heaven  where joy hath no contrariety of woe nor of penance nor grievance  there all harms be passed of this present life  there as is the sickerness from the pain of hell  there as is the blissful company  that rejoice them evermore each of the other s joy  there as the body of man  that whilom was foul and dark  is more clear than the sun  there as the body of man that whilom was sick and frail  feeble and mortal  is immortal  and so strong and so whole  that there may nothing apair it  there is neither hunger  nor thirst  nor cold  but every soul replenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of god  this blissful regne may men purchase by poverty spiritual  and the glory by lowliness  the plenty of joy by hunger and thirst  the rest by travail  and the life by death and mortification of sin  to which life he us bring  that bought us with his precious blood  amen
